"ocd is overwhelming me ocd is overwhelming me 

i find it impossible to relax in any environment and its incredibly distressing my mind constantly generates countless predictions per minute about potential events leaving me unable to feel at ease even in my own home the fear is overwhelming—i cant sit quietly or close my eyes without imagining all sorts of scenarios what if the microwave beeps the lights go out a siren blares or the tv switches on the anticipation and dread of these possibilities whether they happen or not are consuming me does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what i should do it feels like its only a matter of time before one of these fears becomes reality and that thought is really starting to get to me

seriously its not an exaggeration—i likely make 7080 predictions every 5 minutes obsessing over the most obscure and random events in my surroundings as potential signs im at a loss for how to quiet this mental chatter or put a stop to it its driving me absolutely insane",1

"attend a business trip while starting new medication tldr i should be going on a business trip for 4 days with a colleague tomorrow and started new medication bupropione 2 days ago im really stressing out about the trip and dont know whether to got or not

so i have very bad health anxiety since the february similar problems years ago but thats another story probably due to stress since im moving in another country for work next month stress gives me tension headaches and that leads to me thinking i have brain  cancer and whatnot

however since march im in a small startup until end of next month for the next funding round we got a business trip this week one of our ceos couldnt attend since shes busy otherwise therefore i am the only option left to go with our other ceo and also a friend of mine since 3 years the organizer specifcally required two people and one is not enough for whatever reason 

i was really stressing out about this since small meeting directly put me into fight or flight lately last week i made a spontaneous visit at a psychiatrist who describwd me 150mg bupropione he told me side effects are not very relevant and i should start right away rather than wait for the business trip to be over the medication relieved my depression but anxiety is unchanged and i wake up at night with panic 

like this i really just dont want to go on a business trip but canceling everything would mean that my colleague has to go alone 

i cant decide what to do disappoint my colleagues and cringe because i have to tell them about my mental health issues or suffer really hard for a few days hoping i get no major panic attacks

by the time it was 430 i was still doing my hair and makeup i let my mom know and she said that her and my dad were leaving and that i could uber myself there i felt really sad and embarrassed but understood 

i know it was my fault and she has every right to do that a part of me still feels sad she did that on my birthday it was a really low key dinner with just the 3 of us at a restaurant down the street i felt like we would’ve been fine if we left at 5 and still gotten seated 

her strict punctuality has always brought me stress in my life and it doesn’t help having severe depression and anxiety i’ve always struggled with time and i’m always anxious about because of her also different places and people have varying attitudes towards time for example my friends aren’t punctual at all like if we’re getting together at 6 we all know that technically means 6307 that’s just how we are my dad’s side of the family are laid back about time too and are not punctual ",1

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress  i’m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really don’t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesn’t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i don’t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 

so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told she’d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and i’m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool they’ll be home when i’m home oh no i get yet another text saying they’re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasn’t allowed back for the 5th time it’s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like i’m not being told everything 

this has caused me so much stress it’s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also haven’t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later i’ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 

i haven’t eaten since saturday i’ve not left the house in 2 days i’m signed off sick from work for a week i can’t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations i’m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i don’t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 

i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and it’s to the point where i’m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is “safe from things like surgery and icu” it’s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says it’s too much tv but i can’t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i don’t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me

i am hopefully seeing a therapist this week as well as my primary care doctor to see what to do i suffer from high blood pressure as well which introduces another scary factor into the anxiety cocktail i’m facing i take atenolol beta blocker and amlodopine daily which is actually supposed to help the anxiety however i think i’ve just soared into the next level recently 
any tips and tricks are appreciated i have an oura ring to track my stress but sometimes feel like i get so wrapped up in the data i stress myself out more 

apologies for the novel typing this out actually felt very therapeutic and calmed me down

"tired of narc gm 70ftrying to control my life can i block her to tell the truth i really dislike my gm and i only go around her if i have to i’m a 18 m who has had difficulties within his life 

my dad died when i was 3 and my mom remarried twice to two men one who she divorced and had my halfbrother he is a cop and former army sergeant currently in fact one of the best in the county he wasn’t a good man he didn’t care about us truly and once he found out my bro had autism he dipped so quick and was emotionally wasn’t there for 8 years until there divorce 

 the other who she is currently with who is a asshole convict who ruined my teen years by embarrassing and controlling me with his mental abuse which is a story for another time 


i haven’t been around my dadsmy family family in 15 years i’m just now starting to come around them and be with them it’s been great so far as i’m currently living with them and my aunt dads sister has treated me well and i call her mom 

my gm is trying to convince me to move out of the house she thinks that i can live on my own and that i need to get a apartment and do her stupid photo booth business for money  i’ve explained to her multiple times i don’t want to move out as i don’t feel comfortable yet living on my own and on top of that i have autism and adhd and it is required for me to be supervised by adults that’s what my doctor said to me in my diagnosis my grandfather on my dads side and my auntmom both say i need supervision and i’m not mature enough to live on my own as well and i don’t feel comfortable moving but she keeps stressing it and it’s getting annoying

 i’m own the verge of just going off on her i don’t want to be rude but i don’t respect or like how she keeps trying to force and issue that i’ve told her multiple times i’m not interested in doing

she keeps trying convince to go to this hbcu college within the area i reside in that i’m moving from where i’m moving two is about a hour away from me and i’ve told her i going to be  in a community college but she keeps pressing me going to the hbcu which i just told her today i’m not gonna do within her family she’s known for failing within her life she also in the past has manipulated and used others for money and she’s can’t keep money as she constantly spends it on driving and trips and other things she doesn’t need 


she constantly asks people for money when she gets tight on the month and if you don’t give it to her she guilt trips you i can’t do it anymore i’m at a point where i just want to block her  she doesn’t respect others opinions and thoughts and i know there are gonna be people saying “but that’s your gm” but i can’t do this anymore all the stress and games it’s killing me

my mom had cut all ties with her despite her being her mom she tries to control her life as well and i don’t wanna do this shit with her anymore i’m playing to cut her off

"extreme overwhelm during a hiatus from your passion being swallowed by your own worries this may sound specific but i’m curious if anyone else has experienced something like how i have been trying to overcome 

so the situation is  having anxiety over a passion project activity or career that you really care about succeeding in especially when you were once good at it but always suffered from mental health challenges like anxiety adhd and depression  and the perfectionism and self pressure ultimately got you to have so much anxiety that you couldn’t do the thing you love anymore  and the longer you’re taking a break from it to try to focus on bettering your mental health your anxiety has gone up even more still and now it’s been over a year and you forgot really why you want to do it or how you even did it so well

is this sh  a bit of backstory i was diagnosed with anxiety in 2021 and have been on medication since i have no history of sh or thoughts about it i also have been working at a big restaurantbar for about 6 months and really dislike it but i need the money this happened at work about 2 months ago now so it was a hot day and i was scheduled to work for about 8 hours there were lots of wasps around in the outside eating area and they have been known to sting about 3 hours into my shift and i was feeling extremely anxious i found it really hard to concentrate or talk to customers i ended up going to the bathroom and after about 20 mintues i decided to needed to leave and go home all i could think of at the time was to fake getting stung by the wasp to do this i used to end of my key to twist and dig into my skin until it was very red and broke skin i then told my shift manager i have an allergy and need to go home my shift manager sent me home and immediately i felt way better and more calm looking back on it a few months later i have a scar on my arm but i havent thought of doing anything similar since i just wanted to vent and see what you guys think about this or if i should be concerned thanks ,1

"chronic pains from chronic anxiety for the past few months i’ve been dealing with chronic pain that seems to move around my body primarily in my feet—especially the heels—and deep buttocks pain that feels like its within the bones they sometimes switch almost never at the same time 

i’ve undergone numerous doctor visits countless blood tests and several scans yet everything seems to check out okay healthwise a physical therapist ruled out fibromyalgia but suggested that the pain might be linked to chronic stress and anxiety

adding to this ive been grappling with intense fatigue not sleepiness sporadically which complicates things further

this has been an incredibly challenging journey especially because the pain persists and impacts my daily life making it difficult to walk at times its become evident that its not just physical its linked to my mental health however i have dealt well with my anxiety and do not have almost any anxiety feelings or symptomts for months now if anything the pains started after my month long anxiety flare up

i’m curious if anyone here has experienced something similar—chronic pain seemingly from chronic anxiety or stress—and if so how did you cope did you find any strategies that helped alleviate the pain or manage it better over time how long did it take and where were the pains exactly in your body

"stuck for weeks hello i would like to preface this spiel by explaining what i mean by being stuck two weeks ago i had an episode before a test which i rarely if ever get i originally thought it was a bad panic attack characterized by rls heart palpitations constant perspiration and extreme issues concentrating and even being slightly incoherent the test passed i even got a good grade but the feeling still remained days after i feel it slowly going away 2 weeks after the fact but it’s at a rate that is annoying since it feels like barely anything is helping 
on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 

my question to everyone who reads this is “what do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remedies”

ps i’m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks

i sometimes cannot hear what people say to me i can read and speak pretty good english but listening is my worst part after asking them to repeat the questionwhatever they said to me once and i still dont get it i start panicking inside and i come out awkward this is especially in a setting when i dont have time to explain that english is not my first language it happened today when i was playing volleyball with a bunch of new people and at times i just ended up nodding at what they said or saying i dont know there was no time to explain myself as sometimes it was mid game other than that i tried just to be myself and have fun and talk to people but those situations make me feel like people might think im rude or even think im racist if its a person of a different skin color from me does anyone have any tips how i can improve myself in this situation despite trying to get better at listening my husband is american and im so used to his voice and the way he speaks that i understand him but its often hard with new people literally the pitch of their voice their accent how fast they speak make a huge difference in my ability to understand ",1
"health anxiety symptoms disappear on anxiety medicine  i’m so confused i feel nauseous sick no appetite and like something is way wrong with me all day until i take my diazepam that i’ve recently been prescribed after what can only be described as a mental breakdown does diazepam benzos also help with viruses and illnesses a little or is my health anxiety so bad that all these things are made up in my brain i’m just really confused right now i’ve always been a bear down and push forward person until this happened and now i have institutional levels of anxiety which has turned into health anxiety for the last 2 weeks very severe and has turned me into a different person

"direct switch from escitalopram lexapro to sertraline zoloft hi guys
i know there a few posts about this topic but i couldn’t find any recent ones
i have today took the plunge and done a direct switch from 20mg escitalopram lexapro to 50mg sertraline zoloft having been on the former for around 4 months i thought it was helping initially but my depressive symptoms have returned with a vengeance and i didn’t see the point of treading water with a medication that’s not helping
anyway i’ve done a lot of research regarding switching these meds and it seems to be a very individual thing as to how people react to the change
just wondered if people could share their experiences of doing a direct switch with these meds

i still worried about it anyway and to be honest was in a heightened state of panic for the time to follow bc of it then i started waking up with “night sweats” every so often not like drenching or anything like that just a sweaty neck  legs doesn’t drench the bed or even leave a mark when i wake up like this i feel like i’m having a panic attack my heart is absolutely racing i know last night when it happened i had a nightmare

"feeling like you could pass out it’s probably the vagus nerve  vasovagal nerves can sometimes overreact and can even cause vasovagal syncope it’s extremely common especially if you have stomach problems like ibs or gerd and is very common in people who experience frequent anxiety 

the symptoms can include nausea dizziness or lightheadedness blurred vision or tunnel vision sweating turning pale feeling warm ringing in ears and even fainting i personally find that it can trigger panic attacks for me as well 

a lot of people associate the vasovagal response with passing out due to seeing blood or needles but it can also happen due to something as simple as needing to make a bowel movement it can also be triggered by getting overheated standing up too quickly standing for too long coughing being in pain and bending over 

i’m not a medical professional however my mom is a nurse practitioner and has given me tips for when this happens to me which is like 5x a week minimum 

first try lying down flat to see if that helps settle the vagus nerves a bit you can also check your blood pressure as low bp makes the vagus nerves very unhappy if you can’t check it grab yourself a glass of water elevate your feet and have a little salty snack to err on the side of caution if this doesn’t help or if you’re still feeling nauseated make an attempt to move your bowels it may feel more uncomfortable while you’re doing so but will alleviate a lot of the symptoms if you can make a bowel movement if none of the simple tricks work many people find success with corticosteroids or ssris to regulate nervous system responses 

this is the most common cause of fainting can make you feel like you’re having a heart attack and can cause vomiting or otherwise extreme discomfort it’s important to remember that this is all very common and is not considered lethal it’s scary and uncomfortable but it does go away and there are plenty of ways to treat frequent episodes ",1

i keep telling myself that it’s ok i know other people on the program and i’m only here for four weeks so i can go out of my comfort zone because i won’t see most of these people ever again but to me that just feels like a bandaid i don’t believe in myself to truly do that for context these past few months have been incredibly difficult  i suffered a concussion in march and have been frustrated with myself since then the concussion has not gotten better and these frequent anxiety attacks have made my symptoms of it worse before the concussion working out helped me calm down but i can’t exercise right now because of my head and the more i stress about not being to work out the more my head hurts and the longer it’ll take until i can go back to the gym i’m on antianxiety medication i’ve tried therapy in the past and some meditation but right now i just want to stay locked in my dorm room and not talk to anyone

"question regarding dental anxiety  i used to be normal most of my life but due to excessive bullying at school that was all day every day for years i developed panic disorder it hit right after i graduated and it was horrible i thought i had beat it but it would keep randomly coming back and each time was harder and harder to beat eventually i finally reached a point where i was normal again 

anyways most recently about a year ago i went to the dentist for my yearly checkup he told me that i had a big cavity in the 3rd molar on the bottom of my mouth and it had been developing for a year or two i regret not asking him but i was very confused on how they didn’t catch it in the x rays since during that time i was still going in for my yearly checkups anyways he tells me i need a root canal to fix it so i agreed to have it done 

i have never had dental anxiety even when i was struggling with my panic disorder aside from being scared of the gas and being put to sleep anyways i regret not asking about the procedure because i had never had a nerve block before it numbed half my whole mouth and it took me by surprise had i seen it coming i probably wouldn’t have had too much of an issue but since it took me by surprise and i was worried it would numb my whole mouth it freaked me out i just had a small panic attack and was shaking in the chair 

i was actually fine after but unfortunately i began to experience the constant panic disorder again it turns out that dental experience traumatized me somehow so when i go in the waiting room i’m all nervous and it’s like i can’t control it very well i want to just force myself to sit in the chair to have it done but i’m worried about if i’ll be able to control my anxiety or not cut back to now and i’ve recovered mentally also it’s been about a year and a half the tooth isn’t infected to where it’s leaking pus but due to it being broken it has some kind of small infection my head was feeling weird over the year and half but this week it’s feeling even worse i’m scared because i’ve heard you can die from a tooth infection 

i have been looking for dentists but for some reason it’s very difficult to find a dentist who will just pull out my tooth with normal numbing and not a nerve block i was trying to think of solutions but my only breakthrough is that there are traveling dentists who will go to your house to do procedures they do it for nursing homes but i was wondering if i pay them if they would be willing to come to my house because that would help a lot with the anticipation and anxiety i experience at the normal dentist sorry for the rant it’s just i’m running out of ideas and any help is greatly appreciated thank you ",1

she calls me she gets my brother to call me then she calls from some unknown number i should have listened to the part of my brain saying dont answer it its her she has this whole thing about i dont deserve this kinda disrespect what did i do thats got you acting like this what if something bad happened are you on drugs

"i’m terrified right now im absolutely terrified right now i just got my holter monitor results about a week ago from my cardiologist

everything was basically fine expect for a fast heart rate according to him no electrical abnormalities he said my palps were only “fast heart rates” and i was basically just “perceiving” them in my head after the flutter my heart rate was very fast over 100

so i went home happy 

i’ve been engaging in sexual activity for about a week now the first few times no palps no weird feelings nothing 

after today about an hour ago i felt a skipped heart beat in the middle but we didn’t stop then when we finished i felt a flutter as i was laying down 

i got up to drink some water since i thought i was just dehydrated and i thought to have felt mini palps but idk if it was just my anxiety bc i was extremely anxious after the flutter

i’ve been having flutters here and there since the holter monitor appt but i’ve brushed it off bc my doctor said everything was fine

he called me later that night and said if i keep experiencing palps then i’ll go in for a stress test

i’m thinking about doing that now

i started researching cardiac arrest again because im so terrified

someone please help me i dont want to go through this again",1
"best coping strategies  i’m going through a bit of a health anxiety relapse at the moment and am reflecting on what i have learned from my previous flair up to help with this one here is what i have so far 
1 do not google symptoms 
2 seek the appropriate amount of medical care i try to think “what would be doing if i didn’t have health anxiety” 
3 looking after my body  eating nutritious food exercising regularly and getting enough sleep being physically depleted can make symptoms so much much worse 
4 filtering triggering  words from my social media and hiding triggering reddit forums    
5 reflecting on previous flare ups and how powerful my mind can be to create symptoms with no discernible physical root
would be great to hear about the coping strategies of others",1

"anyone else get concerned about a lymph node or other part of the body and keep feeling it until it actually does get sore making your anxiety even worse yeah so maybe you just feel some random part of your body and it feels pretty normal but your mind tells you that you need to keep checking it every 20 minutes or whatever

so fastforward about a week later and now it really is getting a bit sore or perhaps even a little swollen so now your convinced that something is horribly wrong and your anxiety is off the charts because of this vicious cycle so that what was once probably nothing is now a huge issue in your mind and you cant stop thinking about it

"anxiety but without worrying does anyone else get all the classic symptoms of anxiety without the actual mental side of it that makes you worry about actual things i have symptoms 247 and have done for just over 2 years now it’s so draining 

the most frustrating thing is 
1 if there was something to worry about it would give me something to work towards and aim to fix but i can’t identify anything
2 i’m not even sure if it definitely is anxiety because i don’t feel worried… but most people say it is

the symptoms include
 feeling alert  on edge  tense constantly 
 easily shocked
 feel heart pounding strongly though not necessarily fast
 sometimes breathless
 nausea  butterflies in stomach

does anyone else experience anything similar i feel like i’m going crazy and just want to live my life normally again thanks

helping someone understand my fiancé has a problem with empathy and despite being together almost 7 years he truly does not understand depression or anxiety he’s incredibly easy going and nothing is “worth stressing about” to him sometimes i’m depressed and he insists something must have happened but that’s just not how it works he is really unsure how to act when i’m in a rut or having an anxiety attack does anyone have any resources that have helped other people in their life better understand what they’re going through,1
"mental health affecting new job ive been working at this new job for about three months and just as i finally was maybe at the start of getting comfortable a coworker that was considered very valuable got fired for fabricating data and it hurt as well since they were one of the first people to approach and be friendly to me and that pretty much rocked the boat and my anxiety is making everything is back to square one since the atmosphere and vibes feel sooff or something like that since i am aware the place is going to have to adapt without this person

i dont hate the job itself and the peoplehave been nice i just hate that my anxiety has been making getting used to this new job such a struggle and the recent event just made me feel awful all over again i keep getting this gut feeling that the experienced people will get stressed from adaptating to working without the fired person and there will be a mass exodus of people quitting leaving me someone still considered new alone in the dust it doesnt help that since i am still new im still learning and imposter syndrome has been hitting me hard

i just want all this anxiety and uncertainty to stopits been going on too much i keep having breakdowns and crying at home since i feel like i dont fit in sometimes and im scared my bosses are annoyed whenever i make a small mistake even though my reviews have been nothing but positive i just want to go in and feel normal and not feel this mounting dread its especially disheartening since i read that it takes three months to get comfortable at a new job wellits been three months and i still feel anxiousmaybe this isnt the job for me but i need this job so i cant just quit and i suck at everything to find a new job

im just so lost i seriously believed my mental health would improve after working here it hasnt",1

is this zoning out or dissociation or depersonalization  hi good day so i diagnosed myself with anxiety before and then given medication for it when i asked a psychiatrist but didnt pursue checkup and meds after since its expensive here for context i live in the philippines and most of the time check ups or medicine for mental illnesses are not usually covered by health insurance or have discounts so i just cope everyday and hope i wont get anxious these last few days i was told some words that could make me feel anxious or trigger my anxiety such as someone saying i am not worthy of doing some things just because i dont pay for it or so anyway it baffles me since im a sensitive and emotional person who has anxiety but the words that person said didnt trigger me in any way im not sure if anxiety attack or panic attacks were what i experienced a long time ago when someone criticizes me in a bad way but now i feel nothing and i noticed that sometimes i do involuntary actions when i feel ashamed such as head twitch but only slightly a few times like 13 times this happens sometimes only and my real question for this story is as of now its been days since i experience this voluntary and involuntary blurring of the view i dont know if its dilating and not dilating of the pupils but its like staring at something or while doing anything and then suddenly i feel like staring for a few seconds and then my eyesight blurs this first happened to me when i took ashwagandha because it was said it helps for anxiety but i stopped like more than a year ago and i didnt take it for more than a year is what im doing zoning out or dissociation or depersonalization or is it normal because im kind of scared now hahaha i feel weord when i try to do it on my own because its more blurry when it is involuntary as i type this i stop sometimes and it was like 3 times where i involuntarily stared and stopped typing just because my eyesight is blurry again like on command by my body but i dont mean to do it please help if you know something sorry if you dont get my story well ,1

i was hospitalized this time last year…could this be a pattern or coincidence i’ve been in treatment on and off for about a 18 months now in may 2023 i was hospitalized for si since then i’ve been in a lot of programs started medication and have routinely been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist i’m content with my treatment team and meds i have basically been forced “highly encouraged” by parents and treatment team to face my emotions by journaling i’ve been absolutely miserable and have given into unhealthy coping skills i feel like i’m on the verge of needing to go residential or somewhere for awhile the only thing is that there are things on my calendar that are impossible to work around and i have separation anxiety from both my family and pets ,1
"i broke up with my bf because of my psychosis we’ve been together since july 17 last year i was really happy with him and he’s helped me through so much he even helped me adjust to a medication change for 2 months i was really emotional and paranoid during that time period and he was always there to check on me and talk me through it recently or since feb 11 he’s been spending time with his ex who he has constantly reassured me he has no more feelings for he was seeing her because he had a daughter with her and wants to support her still and take care of her his ex wouldn’t allow him to spend time with his daughter without her around which is understandable 
my condition is anxietydepression with psychosis in that i hallucinate and hear things that aren’t really being said but they sound very real to me it got so bad to the point i tried to kill myself in 2021 because i was convinced everyone in my family including all my relatives on my mom’s side hated me and wanted me dead to ease their burden because i was hearing my mom and everyone i live with say insulting things towards me 
on march 22 2024 i went to the place he works which is a bar he works as a waiter and i heard what sounded real to me a girl laughing at me and insulting me saying that they’ve been seeing each other since february my boyfriend reassured me that it wasn’t true and that no one would ever do that to me why would a girl brag about that and insult me in a public place where everyone can hear her 
since then i’ve been paranoid and hearing my bf murmur insults under his breath towards me whenever i was far enough away from him i asked him about it but he reassured me it wasn’t true but last night march 28 2024 it got so bad that i blurted out that i want to break up with him to my bf that i think it would be better because i feel like with my condition i can’t feel like i can’t trust him and i think it’d be better for him if he wasn’t with me because i’m so emotionally unstable and i let what i hallucinate get to me as in i really believe its real 
2 hours later i regretted it after talking with him and having him reassure me everything i’ve heard him say that was negative wasn’t true but the damage had already been done  he said its better we separate on work on ourselves 
i feel so broken hearted and regret my decision to say i wanted to break up but i can’t take it back now he said its better we separate and i don’t want to force him to stay with me if thats his decision 
i’m not really sure why i’m posting this here now i guess i just want some comforting words and advice i feel so hurt because if i was normal without this psychosis i feel like we could’ve been happy together i really hurt him though saying telling more than once that i though he was using me for money to get back with his ex and fix his family 
i guess its better that were not together right i’m not mentally stable and he has his own personal problems that he wants to fix ",1

even today no friends no one to talk cant step out of my house to deal with people  no one is playing hisher part with sincerity like i did and am still doing



people out there are always ready to make others submissive want to take advantage of others take everything what one could provide

im quite not very outspoken take whatever situation gives me but lately i am very frustrated and usually keeps thinking of this only i dont know what to do  how to improve what im lacking of  i am good at most of the things which i do be it working  studying or anything else what this society has been killing me inside i feel like this place is not for good people i keep searching for solutions on internet but to no avail  why there are no good people around me like everyone else had 

if i were to live alone  i might be one the happiest person but that is not a kind of solution



i cant stay happy for long  when i tend to be happy then someone will be there who will always be ready to make my life more miserable and pathetic  im getting tired of all this

"worried and confused help i’m 14f and im curious as to if i have something wrong with me or not i know what it sounds like it may seem like im just another teen who spends too much time on social media and getting the wrong idea and it could just be hormones my mother takes medication for stress and anxiety possibly for bipolar or bpd as well 

something isn’t right in my head something is definitely wrong 
i have major changes in emotions from feeling fine to wanting to end my life etc you get the gist 
to the point i’ve been feeling suicidal since i could even understand what the point of suicide is i have social anxietyanxiety in general and it progressively gets worse each year i’ve tried to take my own life multiple times never serious enough to work or put me into the hospital nobody knows about my attempts just somebody i no longer talk to right now thought about taking it more than actually attempting have trouble with binge eating recently started to purge
when i was in 3rd or 4th grade i wrote a note to my mom for her to find about me feeling sad and wanting to take my own life i didn’t attempt but i felt like i wanted to my mom obviously saw the note and when she picked me up from school she started yelling at me saying i had to reason to feel like this and i agree but why do i feel like this since then i never fully opened up like that towards anyone again for the past two years my moms made it clear to open up to her about anything and obviously i refuse to do that could you blame me she got upset last time i told her anything i’ve suffered with migraines and headaches and recently started seeing a neurologist he told me it seems like i had a lot of stress and that could most likely be the reason for my headaches then prescribed me with propanol 10 mg twice a day it helps with physical anxiety but not mentally doesn’t help with headaches much either

recently i’ve been minorly careless about being mentally closeted towards my mom and told her how i want to be alone all the time told my friends to leave me to sit alone at lunch for quiet like ive always wanted to and my mom has been asking me if i’m depressed and i don’t know what to say she got mad at me last time i told her i thought i was i don’t even know if i’m depressed myself

my next appointment is this upcoming wednesday and my mom picked up a new prescription for my medication that i take for headaches she asked me if the medications messed with my head if it’s affecting my mental health it hasn’t i actually have been off of it not taking it when needed simply because i dont want another thing that i have to do to add onto my daily life it helps with my anxiety it causes no harm towards me as corny as it sounds i am the harm  

i had a favorite person and haven’t had a steady or healthy situation with them they tend to leave then come back multiple times and they recently left maybe a month and a half ago i don’t know if they’re the reason for me feeling worse than usual but that is what’s happend to me recently the only thing that could’ve possibly triggered me into getting worse

is there anything wrong with me am i depressed do i just have major anxiety stress like the doctor said i don’t know but it would be nice to have thoughts about it

the thing is i feel fine well most of the time i just don’t want to interact with anybody i want to be alone i feel too not empty but just blank that i don’t want to waste my energy on anybody  
my dad is the only person who i can actually open up to he always asks how im really doing him and my mom are divorced so i see him every 23 weeks but that doesn’t mean i do open up to him i rarely do and lie telling him im fine he never gets mad at me when i do

in case anyone asks i don’t see a therapist i would like to but i’m too worried to bring that topic up to my mom im scared as to what she would say",1

"feeling like the most uninteressting person in the room seeking advice 
why do i feel like i come across as the most uninteresting person in the world when talking to people i almost never feel like im having a great interesting conversation with anyone it always seems like the other person wants to escape as quickly as possible in groups i barely get a word in i get interrupted or sometimes im not even noticed at all im a loner i love being alone doing things by myself but from time to time i really wish i had someone to talk to or do things with without it feeling awkward

i have a large circle of friends some of whom ive known for a very long time and consider my best friends when i was in school and younger i was really close with some of them and we could talk endlessly about anything but lately ive noticed it becoming more and more awkward 23 of them i would have called my best friend at different times but theyve all moved on and now have other friends who seem to have taken my place at least it feels that way and i never do anything with any of them oneonone when we do hang out its always in a group with their wives or other friends im definitely part of the group im not excluded or anything but im the one who talks the least and gets the least interest the loudest friends always get the most attention even if what they say is often uninteresting

i always feel inferior and submissive though theres so much inside me that wants to come out in conversations my inner voice usually tells me that i have nothing interesting to contribute so i mostly stay silent or in oneonone conversations the voice says its going to be awkward and uninteresting and it usually turns out that way its like a selffulfilling prophecy that keeps confirming itself like a spiral

my mother is from the philippines and married my father german she speaks very poor german and i dont speak filipino ive never had a meaningful deeper conversation with my mother in my entire life my mother is extremely cold and has never been able to show me love now that im older ive realized she has never been able to show real affection to anyone my father has the lowest selfesteem of anyone i know he has never had a real friend and is always by himself when i talk to him it reminds me more and more of how i talk to others nothing interesting comes out always short answers nothing witty everything has to be pulled out of him and that makes me sick i dont want to be like that or become that way when i get older

i have so much to tell i want to talk to people about their fears their dreams and other interesting stuff i want to open up so people can see what kind of person i really am and how much i have to offer

how can i become an interesting person who attracts others someone people want to talk to someone they seek advice from someone they enjoy being around

this obviously affects my love life too ive had girlfriends for longer periods but now ive been single for 2 years and havent had any contact with any women since but its also that i dont even try inner voice again you have nothing to offer a woman right now  so i behave exactly like that around women

is it all just due to my selfesteem do i need to prove to myself what im capable of and what i have to offer so that my inner voice changes positively and i project a different image outwardly i just wanted to get all this off my chest and im really eager to hear what you all think please tell me your experiences and advice",1
"what medication works for anxiety i have tried two ssri’s  setraline and fluoxetine prozac both made me worse instead of better

has anyone else experienced this 

i am looking for alternative medications

i have been taking a probiotic and ashwagandha and cbd gummies 

i have also taking diazepam a couple of times and the relief if good but it’s not a long term fix

i am thinking of trying to do a daily meditation plus a daily walk and writing 3 pages of whatever is on my mind everyday too

anyone got any inspiration of something that worked for them

i basically exhausted myself working in a toxic environment for 3 years and now i have been signed off work for over 6 months and counting

it’s amazing how deeply i wore myself out and the anxiety is staying",1
"anxiety the bane of my existence anyone else experience thus 
at least i think its anxiety 

when im depressed i can still do stuff id just have low energy and maybe question motivations anxiety definitely more on the hyper side of it mentally but it feels like there is no motivation 

sure theres a lot of energy but it due to stress and maybe way too much energy or bad energy 
sometimes i cant even calm myself down it also feels like my head gets migraines as well and i feel like i cant sit still

i avoid people during this because i find i lash out

idk ive been wanting to do art and writing but every few weeks or so just everything would become overwhelming",1
"panicking help a few months ago me and my father were forced to move out of our old house it was a whole ordeal with this awful landlord and overall it’s a long story  multiple times had this done something while we were living there such as driving my slowly even trying to accuse us of tampering with certain things 

after staying with family friends for a month we finally got our own house my dad is older in his 60’s and i am in my late teens also with this we don’t have a large amount of money 

i didn’t realize how bad it was until yesterday when i found myself pacing back in forth between my living room and kitchen talking and almost crying to myself all i could think about is what would happen if we couldn’t afford bills and we’re forced to move again 

i almost convinced myself that my dad was hiding something from me like that were going to be evicted soon because of all of this i always jump to a worse case scenario for everything i’m going through

i don’t know why i do this exactly but i think it helps me try to form a plan for something in case it were to happen today an unexpected guest knocked on the door and i felt like i was going to have a heart attack

i tried to hide at first and i couldn’t breath well and my heart was racing like crazy

i feel like i’ve spiraled into madness and i can’t talk to my father about my concerns because he’s tired of me worrying about everything and as he says “i’m supposed to be the parent not you” 

i have not been officially diagnosed with anxiety however i’ve been told my several people to maybe get checked if you don’t think this is anxiety please say so as i just want to get better and understand my self more

"got my brain mri results back hello all

for a while i’ve been having recurrent headaches maybe for the past 3 months or so the pain comes and goes and is of a very low grade sadly my anxiety latched on to this and convinced me that i have a brain tumour and that i was going to die etc this led to me booking a private mri scan i’m in the uk and i got my results back today

they found absolutely nothing major there was no mass in my brain no evidence of high csf pressure everything that’s meant to be symmetrical is and is an appropriate size they found a small pineal cyst on my mri as well this was written very much as an afterthought

i’ve spent all day freaking out about this and worrying that they could have got it wrong and that i’m going to die i’ve spoken to a doctor and read some medical papers  and it turns out these things are incredibly common and are usually asymptomatic they are benign nonlife threatening and just need monitored to make sure they don’t grow big enough to cause any issues and even that is very rare i won’t require surgery and i shouldn’t need any treatment oddly it’s small enough that it’s likely not even causing the headaches that i’ve been having

oddly i’m feeling a lot better after learning more about what was on the mri report still going to talk to a neurologist but i’m fine 

thank you if you’ve read my post and my experience just wanted a place to discuss what i’ve been going through and my anxiety",1

hey guys

ive been dealing with intense anxiety lately particularly surrounding the fear of getting my girlfriend pregnant during a recent intimate moment when i removed the comdom i noticed my pubic hair inside the base which has fueled my anxiety about potential fluid leaks despite no ejaculation or clear signs of rupture she was on her fertile days btw 

 my girlfriend took plan b 2 days after this as a precaution but im still overwhelmed with worry additionally there was preejaculatory fluid inside the condom which ive never seen before 

many people ive asked including on reddit continue to reassure me that the risks are very low to zero but i could really use some extra support and advice has anyone experienced something similar i already started therapy",1

with all that said do people agree its stress related has others had similar symptoms and if it is stress what do you recommend in terms of healing and getting better is it just time or something else",1

"my anxiety about trying to make my child feel secure and not abandoned is ironically putting him in danger  i just want to preface by saying i am in therapy

i have serious anxious attachment style from my own childhood trauma i have this memory of waking up and seeing my dad and step mom jogging away from me i slept on a mattress in the living room in front of the sliding glass doors i remember feeling so scared and horrible as i saw them outside they decided it was a good idea to go running while i slept i still remember that to this day and i know parents make poor judgments or mistakes but obviously that one really stuck with me im terrified of my child experiencing the same thing

my son is 2 years old and i couldnt do cry it out i feel bad when his room door is closed and he wakes up upset that he cant come and find us in the middle of the night although i know its for his safety when i wake up before him i will open his door a crack so that he can come find me and he struts out happy to find one of us

this morning my husband said he was too stressed to water the front lawn we live in an urban area and our from lawn is super tiny so i elected to do it before i left for work my son was soundly sleeping and i didnt even think to close his door completely so that if he woke up he would be safe in the room i thought that if he woke up in the 5 minutes i was out there that he would just be looking for me and id be back quicky but that his searching would keep him distracted from ultimate panic i thought him waking up and being trapped in the room was worse for some reason eventhouh that same thing usually happens at night but im there within seconds the thought of possibly 3 minutes going by and him being scared and feeling trapped made me anxious

 he wouldnt usually wake up for another 30 minutes i ran outside quickly watered the grass and then ran back inside to find him sitting at the top of the backdoor steps i had forgot to shut the door that leads to the kitchen  basement there is the kitchen door that is then met by another door to go outside the door to go outside was closed but i stupidly left the initial door open right by the stairs that connects the kitchen to the backyard  basement access door 

we usually have a gate up but my husband had taken it down refently for something and it never got put back up and by default we often leave that door open with gate as a signal that someone is outside 

he was just patiently sitting there but i couldnt believe i left that door open and i couldnt help but think what if he tried to go down the stairs he has only gone down stairs back first crawling or guided with your hand

there are about 4 stairs a landing the door to go outside and then about 10 steps to the basement

i feel like i put watering the damn grass above my child but i thought it was a good opportunity to get this quick task in he was in our bedroom that doesnt have a monitor if he had been in his room i would have just brought the monitor with me and watched it as i watered 

i felt so bad that he woke up and probably felt scared that he couldnt find me and that he was near the stairs i was relieved that he was just sitting by them waiting and sort of impressed to think that he knew i was outside 

it was so dumb but i cant wait to get the communication phase where my child understands to call for us instead of panicking if he cant get out of his room and that we will come get him i want to keep him secure and safe without him feeling scared ",1
"what went wrong in my last job im gonna tell my story of what happened in my last job and hopefully you guys tell me what i can improve on

i got hired at this very low end job everyday i start by greeting literally everyone at work even people who i dont know always had this big fake smile because at work you have to greet every customer and coworker like that so i thought but the thing is obviously im extremely awkward shy introverted and have crippling social anxiety depression adhd etc everything to a 1000 and most people can tell that immediately in work some ppl are genuine and are nice back some ppl have this not this loser again this is too early in the morning look and some give out a quiet sigh

so this is my 1st mistake i come off as too desperate not everyone is an npc and not everyone is obligated to be nice

like i mentioned before i have everything on a 1000 and that hinders my work performance socializing and everything i do sometimes i pretty much freeze and are left on peoples mercy and some bad apples will try to take advantage of me some people give out this vibe like if this loser can make money working here than i can hire my own friends and family too and try to get my fired 


2nd mistake im just not assertive or confident enough and with my lack of experience i come off as being too afraid to make a mistake despite being just as qualified as them


its a very low end job so im the only white guy there most coworkers there are really nice to you for the first few days because they dont know if you might be someones friend or maybe youre the bosss nepo hire but once you come out as an outcast introvert who likes sitting alone at the dinner table to avoid socializing you will get very different looks 

the type of coworkers there old coworkers are usually okay there cuz theyve seen it all before white women have this nonchalant attitude like they dont care what happens black arab and eatern european guys are hard working and helpful but they will roast tf out of you they arent that bad most of my time there was working with them black women are usually the most tense to me for some reason they come off as very moody and desperate and would blame me first if anything were to go wrong latino guys are some of the nicest always the one asian dude and chick there were okay but i always felt that asian ppl get the ick super easily they always pick up on the awkward cues arab and latino women feels like they try to be extra nice to you cuz they pity you the one or two fellow socially awkward anxious ppl there made me feel bad

then basically i got fired there cuz a blk wm coworker outed me cuz she didnt wanna work the holidays with a rookie despite telling me she has years of experience herself she wanted to be with someone who would do most of the work so she can chill i got super depressed hearing all this being said to my face infront of everyone im a substitute and dont work there permanently so only when someone is sick i could come in i didnt wanna work for a couple of days after feeling depressed and they fired me after

3rd mistake 


my takeaway is you have to earn peoples respect and trust by being very competent dependable and patient all traits i gotta work on and despite what some people might say its not a just front because im awkward or have anxiety im genuinely a nice guy and i try to be friendly and nice to everyone all the time its just good experience to have for next time",1
"paranoideye contact anxiety  so i have always heard of people having eye contact anxiety i have that but mind is extremely bad it’s like i forget how to look at someone where to look to the point i can’t even hear what someone is saying i’ve pushed every one away i’ve ruined friendships i only have one person i’m truly close to that i don’t have this issue with but everyone else it’s so annoying i feel like i can’t hold a job without the anxiety attacks or make friends without ditching them because of my fear it’s embarrassing to talk about

i also have this problem where anytime i pass by someone i don’t know if i should glance at them or where to look and sometimes i make awkward eye contact i don’t know how to deal with it 

i’m not diagnosed autistic either and i’ve never been tested but i don’t have any concerns i just have issues with this 

i love to socialize i am an outgoing person on the inside i love people  studying them but this has ruined my life and started at 15 or 16… i’m 22 now and it won’t go away i’ve seen doctors and no one gets it they all say it’s social anxiety but it feels very specific and they all wanna shove drugs down my throat that don’t help but make me feel crazy

i always had hard times finding jobs but lately its gotten worse 

ive moved with my girlfriend a year ago and she feels like im not pulling my weight financially she earns more than me but has nothing more than a middle income and shes kinda expecting me to find a job with a better pay

"advice for anxiety  basically im feeling awful and i decided to write to keep my mind busy posting here in case it might help someone typos ahead most likely


one day i was talking to my therapist and i was telling her how much i was tired of living with anxiety and thinking that today whatever day it was was going to be my last because my anxiety kept telling so so i said to her lets pretend my anxiety is right would i want to spend my last day shaking and crying no no i wouldnt 


right now im experiencing some severe side effects because i recently upped my ssri meds and cant do much about it but wait it out and i remembered that when dealing with anxiety the most important things are patience and kindness


i need to recognize my symptoms and repeat to myself that whatever im feeling wont last forever sometimes is hard to believe but i will feel better eventually and even if its only for a little while hours or even minutes i will feel like myself again and that i need to appreciate those moments until i feel better for longer periods of time


do i feel tired yes scared also yes but if i think about it this way what else is there to do but give me the chance to experience another day it helps to give me small achievable goals like drinking water eat something brush my hair wear comfortable clothes brush my teeth being in the sun for a little while etc

right now i might feel like the world is ending but is only temporary in the meantime ill practice self love patience and making it through one day at a time

"is it common to experience extreme tiredness after a very stressful period is over in your life i have been searching for a job for months and been extremely hypervigilant now i got a job and i feel very relieved but notice i am extremely tired

"anyone else get this  dad calls it the bang effect im less eloquent so i call it bad things happen when i wake up in the morning

context longstanding 10 years gad depression not currently on any medication but have taken many different meds over the years particularly the past 3 recently got a prescription for zoloft waiting for it to arrive in the mail also getting care through the va but the process has been slow long and drawn out 

most of the time i am up with the sun or just before it this is not intentional my waking usually consists of me becoming aware of tingling sensations in my stomach and extremities once im aware of it sleeping is no longer possible so i start my day it wouldnt be so bad if thats all it was but thats just the beginning 

sometimes this next stage occurs almost immediately and sometimes it takes a few minutes or even upwards of a half hour to commence something will trigger my gag reflex like a heavy cough or swallowing a pill then the heaving starts if theres anything in my stomach it is unceremoniously evacuated usually happens 57 times on average in the aftermath im left repeatedly swallowing which on particularly bad days can trigger another round of heaving

you know that intense discomfort you get after you throw up thats there too because of course it is appetite gone head pounding heart racing salivating stomach repeatedly and uncomfortably flexed muscle fatigue all within a half hour of waking up

again if this is all it was if i was able to recover afterward i would probably just learn to live with it but it doesnt stop there

that postvomit dysphoria sticks around for hours after the fact on particularly bad days it makes me shaky on my feet i can barely stomach eating anything and when i do eventually force myself to eat its not long before the nausea returns i get a few bites in and i have to stop because my stomach starts lurching again this is probably the worst part of it all because it inhibits my total food intake which in turn means im not getting enough fuel and nutrients for my body to work with needless to say that also makes me feel physically ill after a while

but were still just in the beginning part of the morning this cycle of eat get nauseous stop eating get nauseous keeps going for the rest of the day it tends to get better not good as the day goes on but usually by the time i reach bedtime im still feeling nauseous then i go to bed and rinse and repeat tomorrow

im told this is a stress reaction but its been going on practically every day 56 days or more a week for 9 months straight and semifrequently even before then it occurs when im on and when im off psychiatric medication it occurs despite dietary changes it occurs despite physical and mindfulness exercises it occurs through other medications that are supposed to help with the physical symptoms

i cant come down im activated stressed literally from the time i wake up to the time i fall asleep i feel like shit practically every single day ive lost multiple jobs and a marriage over it at the rate im going i feel like this anxiety will literally kill me if something doesnt change

"message in a bottle for the universe so lately i’ve been in my head a lot and i know how bad that can be sometimes i just turned 23 years old in february so i guess you can say i’m moving more into my mid 20’s life has been kicking my ass lately and it’s my fault i had this girlfriend named t and i met her when i was 21 we were supposed to have a kid but she said it was a miscarriage or she didn’t know she was pregnant at that moment that’s where i pinpointed where everything went downhill for meground zero if you will little by little i started to see feelings change more arguing over me wanting to always see her because at this point in my life i don’t have anyone but her

she ended up leaving me for  her best friend 
i stayed up countless nights crying wondering why wasn’t i good enough i honestly just wanted to die 
why you may ask well i didn’t finish my high school diploma i would get kicked out for fighting because people would try to bully me i had good grades always but my mom moved us around so much i couldn’t finish on time
 i didn’t have a car but i had 2  jobs one of those jobs was with t and around christmas through early january i wasn’t getting scheduled so i didn’t have money to get her christmas presents or birthday present but i did paint a beautiful canvas with a tree that symbolized our love i thought it would be enough but it wasn’t  fast forward 2 years later i’m working at macys and i get fired at this point i’m just being truthful i live with my mom but i always paid my half of rent yknow 
t ends up coming back into my life cause her best friend cheated on her twice i think but this girl is my padmae soulmate so i forgave her and welcomed her back through the time we’ve been separated those had to be my worst two years ever seriously i was depressed looking for work unsuccessfully i couldn’t even move on because of everything me and her went through especially losing a kid in a way it made her my only family 
now up to date she wanted to take things slow but it’s problems because i want to see her for longer than what she sees me which is 2 mins before she goes to work but goes out with her guy friends i’m not controlling you know but i feel like my feelings aren’t being respected so i told her about it and she said i’m not her man and that we’re just talking but everyday we’re lovey dovey saying how much we mean to each other  i just know when people start to lose feelings or maybe i’m just paranoid because of when she left me the first time for someone else
i ended up getting blocked and ignored for 2 days and i just apologized cause i don’t want to lose her i can’t she has all type of guy followers with half a mil 300k followers and it just honestly hurts my heart so much cause she’s been replying dry lately and there was some things she said that just let me know that i can be replaced by any guy that follows her  

i know everyone has their own path in life but i can’t even get hired by a job currently i enrolled in adult school to get my hs diploma im almost done with it but my moms been belittling me and her bf from prison keeps manipulating her to kick me out life seems like i finally hit rock bottom and im scared cause im lost sometimes i wish my father was alive to have guidance maybe my life would’ve turned out better than the decisions i’ve made to get me to this point depressed now more than ever cause my life is passing by just like that and the love of my life she might be losing feelings for me and it makes me so so sad because i want to be able to buy her nice things and go on trips with her and start a family with her but i can’t get hired and i’m struggling on my geometry class on acellus i always try to keep the kobe mentality but it’s hard when you have no one 
it’s 309 currently in los angeles i just had to get this out or else i can feel myself self destruct

having anxiety to even say good morning to my work colleagues i work midnight in logistics and although i dont interact with customers and have a really low mental stress job i still am having anxiety about just saying good morning or just making small talk for the 12min ill be with my colleagues its genuinely getting out of hand,1
please help my life ever since i can remember i get super anxious and cannot stop gagging before i do anything the main thing i noticed as a child was sports or going on a trip somewhere i would gag not stop and puke until the anxious feeling eventually went away even as a 4 year old if my mom wanted to take me out for pizza it would happen then too fast forward to me at 24 it’s impossible for me to even play a casual round of golf with my buddies without gagging in front of them and them being like “wtf is wrong with this fool” i don’t know if something traumatizing happened to me super young and i don’t remember i’m just so tired of living like this i don’t want to be put on medication i’ve had friends addicted to downers and pass away,1
"looking for advice  anxietyocd way of thinking looking for thoughts on this

hi guys im just posting this to sort of complain yet ask for advice about of my ocd habits

for the longest time i was raised by mom to be spiritual and find meaning in things basically shell see symbolism in fucking everything and that has transitioned to me somewhat simce for years ago with getting sticken with generalized anxietyocd ive heavily been making patterns in my head pertaining to types of birds

for example everytime i see hawks in the sky or vultures coincidentally a challenging or rough life event happens shortly after seeing them my brain has made this a pattern and so i fear what might happen if i see more at any point in my life i also have this with bluejays where everytime i feel ive seen one proceeding this coincidentally a rough patch in my life with a relationship be it my love my friends family whatever

i am consciously aware that it is just massive irony and coincidental but my brain has made this a pattern and im looking to sever this garbage and irrational way of thinking

any tips would be wonderful thank you for reading ",1

"health anxiety is ruining my life  i need to vent 

i know most likely im okay but i feel symptoms all the time and whenever i notice them im positive something catastrophic is going to happen for the past like 3 days ive had teeth sensitivity to heat hot drinks food etc its my lower right side and the pain is aching and lasts about 30 seconds now i had this months ago and eventually it went away 

i do have a small cavity there and cavities can cause this 
wearing out enamel can cause it by brushing too hard which i have been and ive been using a whitening toothpaste which is also bad 

i know all of these things and instead of me telling myself just make an appointment with a dentist and get it sorted out 

my mind is telling me that its an emergency and if i dont go to a dentist soon i will get a tooth infection and it will spread and unalive me 

im soo tired of jumping to conclusions im so tired of hearing up water and drinking it slightly burning my mouth to see if the sensitivity is still there im just tired of health anxiety

overwhelmed do you ever get so overwhelmed that you want to cry or scream but instead you go to sleep,1
"that enthusiasm that we all need every day when we get up we need a great interest to do something whatever inspires us therefore it is a quality that is created or developed it helps us to have a new vision of life every day that would be what we call enthusiasm  
there are people who spend their whole lives waiting for conditions to improve for success to come for their work their relationship with their partner or family to improve and then become enthusiastic and the truth is that these people will never be enthusiastic about anything  
if we think that it will not be possible to have enthusiasm because the present conditions we live in seem regrettable it is most likely that we will never get out of that situation that we see as so precarious and we will submerge ourselves more in the mud that we have to live because that is how we are attracting it

i hope that every day each of us and especially you if you do not have it that you find it within yourself that enthusiasm that you need and if you have it that you know how to maintain it sometimes it is not easy depending on the cases especially when there is pain of any kind physical or due to the loss of a relative our enthusiasm can always be affected for one reason or another we are always on trial lets not try our luck thinking that we are invincible but it is necessary to find a way because as i have said it is created and developed that is why we need to believe

i leave you a link so you can see a video from my youtube channel i hope you like it and if you are so kind as to leave a like and subscribe you will help me a lot

my parents divorced when when i was 12  my mom sisters and i had to move to a different state to live with my grandparents and while my mom completed college  he could have moved to our state to be close to us and help out but he moved to 500 miles away in another state to be with friends and party for the next 10 years barely paid child support and visited maybe once a year  he only moved here with us when he had a health scare  we were grown up by then and learned to get by without him  we helped him anyway  yet he always put new girlfriends he had before us  he asked me once to go with him to visit my sister and it turned out he only wanted to go in order to see this woman he met online  we got to my sisters and he stayed for like an hour and left to go see this woman and didn’t come back until the next day 

even after all this we still visit and celebrate father’s day and pull our money together to get big birthday gifts  we always include him in everything  i can’t deal with his selfishness right now and i’m pissed my sister even sent that text to all of us  i haven’t said anything to her or him and i don’t plan to  i just needed to vent  he was never there for me when i needed him  ",1

"the cause of physical anxiety explained  from a recovered anxious person  note im referring to physical anxietyfightorflight triggers and anxiety thats caused by ones psychology not something physiological like low blood sugar coffee high histamine foods etc
 a trigger  something that when encountered we experience a physical anxietyfightorflight response
    examples of triggers physical and nonphysical objects like thoughts people aspects of yourself emotions events memories words and impulses

science  shown that physical anxiety is caused by our beliefsthoughts what we think is true about ourselves things in the world etc but what does this really mean

as someone who has successfully eliminated anxiety triggers and has been a student of anxiety for the past 8 years ill provide an answer using reason and logic  
we have the ability to label and describe things in realtime for example if we see a movie we really like we may say “it was amazing” or “that was great” in the event that we watch something we dislike we may label the movie as “trash” or something we wouldn’t watch again

recognizing that we have this ability to label describe and draw our own conclusions does it not make sense that there are certain things we may evaluate and think we should be anxious about especially since anxiety can be used as a signal for danger these things we think we should be anxious about likely represent some sort of “danger” to us does it also not make sense that our bodies would honor that evaluation and trigger physical anxiety in us whenever those things enter our conscious awareness

some share the view that anxiety is an evolutionary toolfunction for life or death reasons that said some of us have recognized that we can be anxious about nonlifethreatening situations and get anxious about imagined events does this not suggest that anxiety—an evolutionary tool—can be used for nonlifethreatening purposes does this not also suggest that anxiety is just that a tool given to us by our creator that we can apply as we see fit what often happens is we aren’t educated to understand anxiety this way and used anxiety in our past as a protection mechanism for certain situations and events while unaware of the longterm impact doing this could have we did and unknowingly still do this as a way to take care of ourselves

so we get anxious about things because we think we should beget anxious about whatever were anxious about we likely picked up this way of thinking when we were younger  heres a graphic summarizing this post

unconscious  something that exists that were unaware of cambridge dictionary

the information in this post was a gamechanger for me because it helped me understand why i get anxious whenever i do i worked with mental health practitioners and read several books but never truly understand the cause of anxiety physical this info also helped me understand what people meant by anxiety is caused by your beliefs

belief  something that is accepted considered to be true or held as an opinion cambridge dictionary

when i say recovered anxious person i mean im someone who no longer is confused whenever i get anxious and i know how to eliminate anxiety triggers that pop up in my life

a trigger  something that when encountered we experience a physical anxietyfightorflight response

"rantnervous breakdown my psychiatry office needs clarification to make sure i can still receive help because im living at the mission i owe money because of no shows due to reasons that tie into my diagnoses so i have to get billings approval and even admin approval ive been dealing with that for some time now so that doesnt really cause me anxiety 

but today theyve told me that they have some returned mail and i told them im staying at the mission and they said theyll need to call me back so they can get clarification on whether or not they can schedule me

because apparently they need an address for safety reasons 

and to be fair she did say that she just needs clarification so being at the mission might not affect anything 

but im anxious im mad  im sad  im disheartened

there are so many people who are homeless who would benefit from therapy and if they cant get it because they are homeless or living at the mission then what is this world coming to 

and if they cant schedule me ive already been seeing my therapist for just over a year and im still in the trying to open up stage if i have to switch i feel like itll be another year before i can get back to where im at now in terms of therapy 

i cant mentally afford another year this past year has already been rough enough when i had stable housing and my cats that ive had for ever but now im homeless at the shelter and i had to give my cats to the humane society because i couldnt bring them with me

reason for the tag      
im deathly afraid of dying but most of the time i dont want to be alive and im scared because depression can change abruptly what if one day my brain goes you know what youre not afraid of anything and what if that fear was the only thing holding me back from doing anything permanent

im going to keep looking on the brightside because thats what ive always tried to do 

but holy hell  i didnt expect to be this anxious this early in the day

i just needed to rant and get my worries down i checked the rules and i didnt see anything about rant type things so i hope its okay

29f and not sure if i’ve had bad experiences or being dramatic hii i can’t tell i was chronically depressed from 1623 and would always obsess all day about killing my rapist and friend who abused me but i managed to work through a lot now it’s like yeah i am functional and anyone around me would call me happy go lucky and think i’ve had an easy life but i think i still have anxiety from most things in life i can’t even really eat in front of people or take rubbish out in front of others because for some reason it makes me feel vulnerable and embarrassed lol or like if people close their eyes at a sauna i’m like how do they not feel vulnerable and idk i’ve had a breakdown and in therapy now and i’m just like i can’t even explain my trauma cos it’s like “yeah my dad was moody friend was awful got raped” doesn’t even sound bad but here i am at 29 still feeling like i’ve had my mind taken from me it’s like mental abuse is so deep in your mind it just never ends nobody has ever taken accountability and so i go through life unable to say how i feel about when people upset me in fact i literally have had someone punch me in the face and say it’s fine lol cos i just gaslight myself into me being wrong and that it’s not worth talking about because conflict feels like i will be punished in the end idk has anyone else had this kind of abuse too ,1

"stress is destroying me scared of losing my apartment  ive dealt with anxiety stress and trauma to varying degrees my whole life but my current situation has been such extreme high levels that i legitimately fear its killing me im in extreme debt from having to life off credit cards while unemployed for 8 months literally over a thousand job apps places during that time and ive only recently been able to find part time work which is progress and im happy about it dont get me wrong but i still cant afford my rent 

lease ends this month dont meet income guidelines to get approved for a cheaper apartment anywhere need to make 3x the rent so id need to find checks notes a 350 apartment in the year 2024 obviously not happening desperately afraid my landlord wont renew he said he needs to put me on a monthly rental agreement for a couple months and then we can do another yearly lease something about management company working having a rent increase starting in september and new contracts if im on monthly that means he could legally decide to issue a 30 day notice to move out for no reason and since he does not like me im scared that hes doing this intentionally to trick me and fuck me over also having serious surgery coming up in august so being kicked out right now or especially after my surgery would be extra devastating

i keep trying to be hopeful that things will turn but the closer i get to the end of the month the more scared i become that i will be served a notice to vacate i also want to vomit every time i see my credit card balances go up by thousands in interest plan to work with a bankruptcy attorney soon if i can afford it but im at the point now where i feel strung out 247 barely able to eat vomiting from stress pretty regularly just feels like im sitting around waiting for this vacate notice which might not actually even happen

ive been seeing a therapist for ptsd and stressanxiety for over a year now and she keeps telling me im doing amazing considering everything but i most certainly am not i just dont feel like she really sees or hears my pain and despair and that makes it all the worse same with my friends they just dont seem to understand and give me empty platitudes that everything will be okay without any actionable logical advice or any real comfort

has anybody been in a similar situationsimilar level of stress were you able to do anything to help you feel prepared in case your biggest worries become reality i think thats my main issue is that i just have absolutely zero backup plan if i suddenly can no longer live here

around january 2022 i experienced my first manic episode 6 months later i had my second and was hospitalized i finally got diagnosed with bipolar disorder it was a few months after i turned 26 after the second mania came the worst depression i had ever known i was really suicidal it lasted about 6 months i went to therapy and started taking meds without both im sure i would have killed myself

"how to help a friend with social anxiety  hi there i have this friend with social anxiety he has a history of this along with bullying and im trying to help him for a couple weeks we are both teenagers in school btw he has been been bullied  call names etc in childhood which has effected him during teenage years he has also moved house and school during early childhood which has developed his social anxiety

so back to the present this friend of mine well cal him x x is shy and struggles to make friends he refuses to push himself and choose to stand in the corner of the playground at break time and play with his rubix cube while looking sad i felt bad for him so went over there and started talking to him he talked me about his lack of confidence and his hard past but when i ask what he has done about his confidence not much has been done he claims that no one likes him but when i encouraged him to make friends he went to a group of friends and just stood there and watched them talking thats a pretty shitty way of making friends he does this for a few weeks and goes back to his little corner crying about his failed attempt he is very sensitive in school football if he doesnt score a goal he will cry about that even when hes a new player and he is competing with those who play in the schools a team we tried to encourage him to set realistic expectations and it worked for a while before he started ignoring that advice and went back to being emotional he also struggles to talk to people i tried to tell him to do it anyways so the fear is lessen but he cant discipline himself to do so a few months ago his grandma and aunty died which amde him really sad but eventually he got over it he used to claim he has depression until he talked to a therapist and therapist told him was just overwhelmed after the therapist visit his mood has significantly improved but his social anxiety still remains he is too scared to go to crowds meet new people make phone calls go to events raise his voice etc he cries and complains about his confidence but when i show him how to solve it he backs away let me give you an example there is a local martial arts club which do confidence classes and i thought this would interest him i tried to send long messages to convive him to go but he wont budge i tried both being nice and being mean when he responds hell say ill think about it code phrase for no or just straight up no i tried to get him to do prank phone calls as i thought this would be a funny and entertaining way to build his confidence he still said no in drama to avoid his fear of performing he ask to leave the classroom and was even given a card to do so i proposed to him that i would take his card and he would face his fear of performing his response seems like he was offended the only thing ive managed him to get to do is to ask to go to the toilet which he said he was afraid of but thats probably because he wanted to leave the lesson he was in anyways

i think hes being slightly unreasonable personally i moved 67 times in my life and had to learn how to adapt to this ive been through bullying but ive also been in some nasty crowds  
even when i go through hard times i can discpline myself to seem happy instead of hiding in a corner i remember also feeling like i was going to shit myself when meeting new peoplegoing to new clubs but i did it anyways and he cant seem to do the same he also seems not interested in solving it if i ever have a problem i would do anything it takes to solve it i do prank calls and while the first is scary it gets better overtime i think he just lacks discipline while i understand family death everything else is just him being lazy

we live in the uk if that helps and i have may missed out some details

how do i convince him to make the prank phone calls go to the confidence classes and overall reduce his social anxiety

ps as for myself i dont need mental health support i can deal with my own problems myself and only seek for help if im genuinely stuck in life like in this situation how can i have him have the same mentality",1

"anxiety that has turned into derealization and severe depression ive always had anxiety disorders cardiophobia dizziness tachycardia headaches etc but it was mainly cardiophobia i had seen a cbt therapist who had helped me a lot but for the past few weeks my anxiety has returned without any particular reason or trigger after a major panic attack i experienced severe derealization to the point where i no longer dared to leave my house everything outside seemed unreal as if i felt lost in my own neighborhood i had to force myself to go to work as usual but since then i feel empty and completely depressed with negative thoughts looping in my head and a constant feeling of malaise with no outlook for the future i feel dead inside 



what is quite paradoxical is that my physical anxiety has been replaced by a dark depressionderealization to the point that i am forced to push myself in sports to feel some sensation and to feel alive whereas before i avoided pushing too hard because i was afraid of having a cardiac malaise or a heart attack



i find depression 1000 times more severe than my previous troubles the world seems unreal with negative thoughts looping and i especially feel like nothing can soothe me with anxiety i could use beta blockers breathing techniques benzos etc now i feel completely lost and stuck in this infernal spiral

"stress at new work and histery about making a mistake aloha everyone

i feel like a lot of people deal with work stress throughout the wowking days and possibly lots of u on your off days as well and that it almost feels like a routine or at least something that crosses your mind before arriving at work so i was hoping that some of you could share your ways of coping with this mental monster and energy vampire

im having a new job which ive started 15 days ago after 15 days of training course im working on a reception for a very first time as i didnt study for it nor have any previous experience and i have an abnormal fear of making a mistake  let me explain my job doesnt include only reception as itself but also the restaurant part from taking care of the documentation to taking care of their money contracts scanning the papers writing mails communicating for all their needs with suppliers and informing them on all of that and documentation of all sorts which includes housekeeping on the side with reception and restaurant as well water company sanitary inspection i also take care of catering that our restaurant does as we are the only mediators between those airlines and the restaurant i also have the obligation to inform our superios on other sectors shifts how their works going etcetc thats a lot of fucking information and beleve me when i say that even if you write it all down you cannot possibly find what you need in that moment when you need it especially not when there are guests waiting to check in waiter coming to our reception for the exchange of money and our companys driver looking over guests shoulder reminding me that he needs things done for him at the very same moment and there are couple of actions happening at the same time almost the whole shift

the biggest problem in all of this is that i know its impossible to avoid mistakes the very head of the reception whos got 10years working experience and college for this very profession admitted to me that even after all these times she makes mistakes and that its completely normal but when it comes to my mistakes i have to listen about it from 3 different people read about it in our group chat and then read about it in our receptionists book as well i guilt trip myself even harder after that even though i know that its a fresh start for me and that i shouldnt be hard on myself i still find myself dreaming about my work having unconcious thoughts of it and talking about it too much 

so im asking for the help one more time it would mean a lot",1

could stress be the cause   hey 19m here and i started having stomach issues a couple days back atleast significant issues i’ve always had bloating and acid problems from over eating or too much spicey food… but specifically 3 days ago i went to the hospital for a family friend who was shot in the head… it was a very traumatic experience to witness and when i came home i felt very weak and had very low energy levels… i ate once all day and was not able to sleep at night the next day i woke up feeling bloated or just very full of airgas similar to when i over eat except i hadn’t ate much at all… i had a fever of about 1007 fahrenheit… throughout the day i had very loose stools about 3 times… but as the day went by any signs of pains and weakness including the fever went away… except the only thing that stayed was the airgas feeling with like grumbling and gargling sounds from my stomach… mind you this is 2 days ago… yesterday same feeling it kind of comes and goes as i take my mind off of it but i start to feel it and i panic and it gets more intense… not sure if it’s just stress induced or not i’ve been eating very small bland meals and am starting to try to get a bit more active since i’ve been very inactive the past few months only started today lol but wondering if anyone has had anything similar or any knowledge to what this could be… i now feel completely fine except for the bloated airgas feeling in my stomach and a constant burping… i really havent ate much either but i was able to poop once today and last night color was light brown or possibly a darker yellow i’ve pooped like that before with no issues so i’m not sure and very confused as to what it could be… ,1
"anxiety about neighbor noise in a semidetached house i am totally blessed to have a great house really nice neighbors and to be really close to family but the noise my neighbors make really drives my anxiety through the roof if i can hear the slightest bit of music or noise even if its not that loud or totally reasonable to my wife or a normal person it just sky rockets my anxiety and i feel like i have to leave that moment it makes me want to move even though thats not a financially smart decision at this particular moment

i definitely could ask them to be quieter but im quite confident they are not making a lot of noise it just feels like such an invasion i even sound proofed our walls so we no longer hear voices and at that time the noise was super bad but it still eats away at me at this reduced volume i know that if you feel anxious about a noise it really stands out and its all i can think about

"help  am very attached to a toxic friend i have had most of my life i grew up with my mom and i only saw my father a few days a month i was never close with family members because they either suffered from mental issues or drug abuse on both sides so i was kept away for safety reasons i remember having self harm thoughts around second grade and would imagine hurting others or i would hurt myself i met my friend in early grade school and had to be her friend at the time girls were not into video games or nerdy subjects so to find another girl that liked similar things was a bonus we both had troubled families and liked similar things we began obsessively writing rp roleplay where we could be our own characters and have perfect lives with these characters we loved and be together i noticed how much she loved her male fantasy characters so i started having a sexual relationship in late grade school with her we were the same age and kept it a secret im not sure why because im not gay but i think i just wanted to feel loved snd important to someone even if i had to pretend to be someone else
we stayed friend a long time until a death in her family drove her to drop me as a friend while she spiraled out of control with her life she would often be my friend just to drop me again any time she had a boy friend or a friend she seemed to forget about me she would show little to no interest in my life she did not come to my wedding she did not come to my baby shower etc  through most of this we keep rping though we do not get along in real life she acts completely different in rp in rp she is the perfect friend i want but in real life she cant i do everything for her i give her anything she wants and visit her constantly but she never returns it to me she cant act loving or caring towards me but in rp  she can we both thrive and live off rp to stay calm in life because thats how we grew up but rp is almost a tease to me
 we fight so much because i do all the work in the friendship that she insults me etc but she never quits rp  is this a form of control ive told her that i love her and care about her very much but i dont think she feels the same about me im in a relationship now and have weird reaction to having sex whenever i have sex with my boyfriend its fine and normal but when its over i break down and cry because my brain likes to remind meof when i was young and intimate with my friend just to know they never cared about me 
i know this is a lot but i did my best to make this as short as possible this issue bothers me everyday for other 10 years i constantly cry and hate myself and even hinted suicide to her and it dosnt bother her i am constantly stoned so i can try and ignore how hurt i am from her my boyfriend thinks i view her as a much better person than who she really is because i want a friend",1
"brother ruining his life over ex gf  basically my younger brother which is 22 nowhe was living the dream finishing college had a nice car nice penthouse and nice well paying warehouse job that payed him over between 40
45 an hour i cant remember exactly but it was a good paying job  even had a gf he was planning to marry  have kids with  they even took tons of trips together 

he was doing wayyy better than me during and i was inspired by it and he was just becoming an inspiration to me  butttt

his gf left him for another dude a whole year ago and ever since that happened he crumbled he stopped showing up to school  he lost his job due to not showing up to work lost his car due to him not paying his car payment  lost his nice penthouse he went back to staying with our mom thats the only nicest person we have in our family because he went broke ive even noticed he lost tonsss of weight atleast
4050 pounds he barely works out looks like a skeleton kinda 

but hes doing this to himself unfortunately all hes been doing for the past year is sit in his room in our moms house eating or in bed he cant function anymore without his ex  i could tell he doesnt do anything he even went ghost on his old school friends

we use to be very close but her leaving him fucked up his mental psych i never thought this was capable to happen to him bc i seen him as strong all my life but life happens

every time i try to call to talk he ignores it he only texts me only if i text first its making me feel sad at this point bc i cant help him  even when i come to visit him  our moms he barely talks to me  looks soooo depressed i can tell he trys so hard to put up a fake smile atleast until i leave then he just goes in his room  locks the door all the time hes hit rock bottom  me  my mom dont know how to help him i understand he was in love with that girl but its no way a female should have this much power over you  it just shows me he was never really connected to reality that girl built him up  possibly made him… its sad miss the old person he was

"anxiety journey hey all ive seen a lot of posts on peoples struggles in this group ive struggled with anxiety since i was 17 now 31 over the course of the last year ive gone from not being able to leave my city to doing a 14 hour road trip several 23 hour trips and returning to the office for work with little to no anxiety i wanted to take the time to share what worked for me in hopes that this will help someone else out there 

first off my anxiety presents as extreme nausea it started off as panic but shifted to nausea i struggled for a long time with basic things like driving and going to restaurants or really anywhere because i needed to have easy access to a bathroom in case my nausea overwhelmed me i also have emetephobia so the combination of the two made things extremely difficult for me 

since last year i decided i wanted to stop hoping ill get better miraculously  and decided i was going to get better instead of being sad all day i chose to do something about my anxiety since nausea was a huge contributor to my anxiety i started with that i found a product emetrol on amazon and i take that before i do any anxiety inducing event or if i feel nauseous it tends to eliminate my nausea within minutes

i previously tried to take prescribed ssris but these made me feel worse as an alternative i found levium which can be had without a script and is a take as you need natural anxiety relief instead of a daily pill with tons of side effects  

for my nausea i also use a reliefband its called it works similar to one of those sea sick bracelets or a bracelet a pregnant woman might use to put pressure on a point on your wrist that stops nauseavomiting 

all of these things in combination have greatly reduced my anxiety to almost nothing ive done talk therapy for many years and have a supportive therapist and this also makes a huge difference the biggest thing ive learned is that no one can make you better besides you you need to decide that youve had enough and you want to figure this thing out you dont want to wallow and be sad and pity yourself for how hard things are that will always dig the anxiety pit deeper choose to be better at the end of the day anxiety is a mental disorder and just as much as our brains can tear us down we can also use our brain to build ourselves back 

i feel like a new person i was a shell of myself for 13 years i could barely leave my house for several of those years life was reduced to just surviving basic tasks like getting gas instead of living 

one of the hardest parts for me was getting out of the mental rut i was in where i put myself down all the time i found that when i did some soul searching i felt like a burden and wanted to please everyone else because i felt like my anxiety was impacting everyone around me i wasnt wrong it was hard on the people i love the most but i was so consumed with guilt that i never did anything for me

i always loved collecting trading cards as a kid but got bullied out of it in school and stopped i decided that i was going to collect cards again because i love it and it makes me happy one of the biggest points of advice i can give is to find something easily accessible that you can do that will always make you smile if you can get your day off on the right foot youll see such a massive improvement take time for yourself love yourself find time to just be and time to enjoy what you love if youre spending your entire day being an anxious wreck its hard to find a starting point to get better and thats all you need a starting point 

i really hope this helps someone even if its just one person find what you love and hold onto it do it daily if you can give yourself credit for the little things if youre in as deep as a pit as i was baby steps are good enough you need to give yourself credit for trying for still being here i used to fail at getting groceries id go in and freak out and leave i would tear myself down for it once i started to break down all the things that go into going to a grocery store i improved dramatically giving myself credit for committing to go giving myself credit for driving there credit for going in the door even if i failed at getting anything i got credit for 3 different things to 1 failure and then the next time id go id grab a small shopping basket instead of a cart because that felt safer i got what i could fit in the basket and left now im up to at least 4 wins and just like that i didnt fail  set attainable goals please do not give yourself all or nothing goals break one goal into 10 small goals so you always have areas where you win 


im happy to talk in dms replies on this thread anything to help just let me know i believe in every single person on this sub and i am proud of all of you for being here being here and wanting help and wanting to be better is the first step i had many points in my life where i didnt know if id be here at 30 years old i know what those dark pits are like the panic attacks the hopeless feelings  but it doesnt have to be this way forever ",1

"i need help but i don’t ask for it tldr at the bottom 

wasn’t sure which flair to add probably more anxiety help but also depression help

22m so i guess the reason i’m posting this is because i think i should ask my parents or a friend for help but i continually hide my pain i only will share it if someone really prys it out of me 

i am so uncomfortable with reaching out about something like this it gives me very deep shame and embarrassmentfeeling stupid easier on reddit i guess

i go through high highs and low lows when i’m in my highs i sort of forget that i was struggling or don’t care to think about it because i don’t want to ruin my good feelings then in my lows i don’t have the energy or motivation to get help

 i just wait until someone happens to really ask how i am

anxiety depression adhd working my first office job 6 months in i’ve had hard weeks but overall it’s been manageable but now i am pretty burnt out and mental health is exponentially tankingspiraling 

i am so afraid of getting fired or quitting because i felt so proud that i have a stable and well paying job that will lead to career opportunities i have told many people about my job and how it’s great and felt so proud idk

on paper i have a really good life parents are pretty well off have always raised me and siblings in a loving and caring way i am athletic good genes live in a beautiful city my office job has a pretty relaxed environment my boss does not micro manage at all i know a lot of guys who i skateboard and snowboard with i have guitar and drums as an outlet i’ve gone to therapy and learned skills for managing my emotions 

despite all this i currently feel anxious often insecure depressedhopeless i think about how i wish to die every day pretty much the last week it’s been almost every minute 

i really don’t think i would motivated by the amount of pain i would cause my family the way people close to me would see me as a cowardgiving upselfish it would be such a waste of a good life

but i wish so badly that no one knew me and i could die and no one would care

the depression and anxiety sucks but the shame of it makes it twice as bad i shouldn’t struggle this much  there’s people with extremely significantly harder lives that are managing to keep going so the fact that i want to give up makes me feel like a weak and pathetic human i know i shouldn’t compare but i do i guess

tldr

so anyways i just don’t understand why i let myself struggle alone and want to be alone in these things it’s almost like i know if i have mental struggles i will be allowed to take the easier routequit my job or relax i don’t know

i just know i need to talk to someone or it will keep spiraling i feel so trapped and alone but it’s so hard to reach out to be the one to initiate contact makes me feel so stupid and lame",1

"i feel like giving up  

20years old
i fell asleep 10 months ago and woke up with visual snow it was as if i had a nightmare that never ended since then i have regularly experienced panic attacks and developed depression at first because i knew nothing about visual snow i was terrified of going blind and because of the panic attacks and constant sadness my girlfriend of five years with whom i lived left me on my birthday saying that my burden was too heavy for her

so i lost my job couldnt continue studying and had to move back because my parents had divorced a few years before and had to sell the house due to debt i had to live in my grandmothers house in my moms old childhood room

that was the first part

my best friend approached me and suggested that it might be better to go to a psychiatric hospital which i did there i felt so bad that i asked for medication because i was suicidal thats when i felt this sensation for the first time which in hindsight caused me irreversible damage the fear was so great that i think it broke me at that moment

i was at the point where i thought either you kill yourself now or you try to participate in life somehow and do everything you can to avoid feeling this fear so i was discharged and tried to rebuild my life but since then i feel like im not the same person anymore every time im slightly happy im afraid of waking up the next day with a new blow of fate

ive also started dating again and the last girl told me that she would like to fall in love with me but cant and doesnt know why these feelings dont arise

i feel like since i got vss ive been followed by bad luck i feel like the harder i try to build a life the more i crash into a wall everything i cant control goes wrong my brother has also developed depression and suicidal thoughts and i really like helping him but its very mentally exhausting

i dont want to think like this i dont want to have this fear of being followed by bad luck but it very much feels like every good feeling turns into fear because of the experience and i wonder if it will ever get better and if ill ever think that it was worth the effort

"can someone help me figure out what i have hi there i’m a 30 year old female who has been suffering with this for quite sometime when i was young around 8 i started getting these issues where whenever i would watch horror movies like gore or blood related i would get really worked up and feel faint and almost like i was going to vomit after that i couldn’t deal with anything medical related seeing the sight of blood needles gore etc would trigger something in me that would make me feel like i was about to pass out as i got older it never got better i’ve never actually fainted from it before but the fear of fainting has always felt so strong that if i don’t distract myself or find a way to escape i certainly feel like i could pass out this has led to recently a whole bunch of problems i can’t watch any medical videos or tv shows being in hospitals or doctors offices trigger this even if someone i know is telling me a story of someone who is sick or dying or a medical issue etc i get really faint and can’t hear it  and when i feel like i can’t escape it i truly feel like i’m about to pass out 

i’ve suffered from generalized anxiety for about 15 years now so i’ve always blamed my anxiety for it but sometimes this feels totally different i even have a dentist appointment this week and i’m a nervous wreck that i’m going to feel this faint feeling at the dentist  i don’t even wanna know what will happen when i have to get a cavity filled i want to have children and just the sheer idea of being pregnant having to draw blood and be in doctors officeshospitals and having to hear about medical stuff makes me so unbelievably afraid and feel faint

"has anyone else gone through what feels like a nonending panic attack i 26f have struggled with anxiety for a few years now with occasional panic attacks  usually when im feeling trapped or claustrophobic a couple of years ago my doctor prescribed propranolol to take on occasion when i felt i might have a panic attack and they seemed to work for me if i felt myself getting panicky id take one and itd go away and then id be perfectly fine again

however just a few days ago i attended a concert and felt a little off before it even started i found out im pregnant about a week before and so was a little worried about feeling sick or dizzy i took a pill they are apparently fine during pregnancy and still ended up feeling extremely anxious to the point where i had to leave and sit in the hallway till i calmed down i managed to go back in and went home feeling a little shaky but relieved i showered ate and when i got into bed i realized i still felt very anxious for no apparent reason it was like i was on the verge of a panic attack but just keeping it at bay

the thought omg what if i dont stop feeling like this ever came into my head and thats basically exactly what has happened since i hate my mind 

i woke up the next day its the first thing i thought of and i literally had the worst day of my life i could not relax i was shaky my heart was beating fast all day i couldnt stop thinking about how this is never going to stop and panicking more i basically lost all my appetite i felt as if i let myself stop focusing on not letting the panic escalate that id go into fullblown panic attack mode i spent the whole day freaking out because i felt like i cant leave the house ever again i have a vacation planned in a few weeks that i wont be able to go on like this  i wont be able to have a baby like this etc 

i managed to sleep at night woke up the next day and same thing  which scared me more this day was maybe 2 better today the third day maybe 5 better but its like the second i have nothing to focus on i start panicking again 

my doctor prescribed me an ssri today but i dont know if i want to take it ive also got an appointment with a therapist tomorrow ive been doing better today until now when its evening my work is done ive showered and i have nothing to do for hours but sit and try to distract myself still not much of an appetite 

has this happened to anyone else did you get out of it i want to cry because 3 days ago i was excited for my baby and vacation and summer and now i feel like my life is over and i cant face it all and im scared this will never end

"medication switching sucks any advice or experiences that might help so i’m talking to my doctor tomorrow about medications but i don’t know what to even say i have some stuff written down but idk i always feel so awkward at the doctor i’m canadian and my doctors always use the drug name instead of the brand i was on escitalopram for a long time then eventually went to sertraline after my cptsd diagnosis zoloft i believe for a long time but i found that i was incredibly brain foggy the higher my dose of sertraline went and my friends and roommate noticed that my memory was extremely foggy and it was impacting my daily life so i asked to switch in december and i’ve been taking buproprion wellbutrin for a bit more than 2 months and i maybe feel the worst i’ve ever felt on medication i’m anxious all the time everything feels like a big deal everything makes me cry and every smell and food makes me want to vomit 

should i maybe go back on an ssri i was thinking about fluoxetine but idk i really don’t know if there will be much of a difference between sertraline and fluoxetine or any of the other ssri i just want to feel functional again and not scared of everything anymore i’ve been spiraling and panicking for days and i just want to feel alright again and also have control of my brain with no foggyness is it so much to ask  

would anyone be able to shed some light ‍ all i can do is think in circles i’m going to a convention next weekend and i’m lowkey high key terrified of social interaction and travel maybe xanax would help too idontknow i’ve never been on it and the doctors here are very hesitant to prescribe it but i think i might need it because no amount of mindfulness and deep breathing can bring me out of my panic attacks rahh",1
how do i convince myself that just because i do the same thing as someone else im not copying them i know this definitely sounds pointless but its really in the title i have veerrryyy bad anxiety so i tend to do that common anxiety thing where you feel like everyone is constantly watching you and judging your every move it makes somewhat simple things like taking inspiration just doing my own thing and even following trends difficult for me usually i can convince myself to not be so selfconscious but theres a certain situation im facing a lot of difficulty in basically theres these 2 people i know who do a very specific thing not specifying everyday that i really like and would like to take inspiration from as well but as usual that worm in my brain keeps screaming at me theyll think youre copying them and hate you forever again i can usually talk myself out of these thoughts but its just not working this time really how do iwhat are some tips to convince myself that the entire world will not hate me just because i took somewhat specific inspiration from those people,1

"how to justify my “sudden” claims of my anxiety issues so i’m almost certain that i’ve had problems with anxiety for my whole life but it was more of what i didn’t do rather than it feeling like it had impact on me things like avoiding phone calls not talking to anyone avoiding classes etc lots of overthinking and sleepless nights too 

but now it’s gotten much worse i started university after a year long depression spiral everything seemed to be going well until it didn’t skipped class here skipped lecture here before i knew it i had a lot of material to catch up on then i had a month long leave bc of surgery and i went back just in time for all the exams completely unprepared 

my resting heart rate is 140bmp on regular basis i feel nauseous i constantly have episodes where i just space out for hours overthinking and panicking i have tension headaches i can’t sleep and when i do it’s impossible to wake me up for hours i’m extremely distracted despite taking adhd meds i have weird symptoms like cold hands and feet numb feelings too ringing sounds in my ears i’m also constantly paranoid my depression will return 

there’s probably more and it gets worse and worse i recall sometimes feeling like this but not to this extent and not for this long 23 months slowly accelerating 

the thing is i have no idea how to bring it up with my psychiatrist i recall specifically answering his questions about anxiety during our first meeting saying i don’t have any as i just couldn’t think of any situations i guess with my parents i stopped talking about my mental health problems unless absolutely necessary as they think i’m doing this to myself on purpose and i’m trying to solve everything with meds in therapy i sometimes talk about specific situations but it’s always solving those small problems resulting from a larger issue i also seem to always downplay everything when talking about it 

i have a psychiatrist consultation tomorrow just 20 min to renew my prescription really i don’t know what i want a diagnosis to know what’s wrong with me another medication on top of everything else i just want this nightmare to stop i feel absolutely awful and with approaching exam session it’s only going to get worse i have a real possibility of falling in first semester of first year at college so how do i justify it all to my psychiatrist to my parents if psychiatrist decides to take some action does it even need intervention if it looks like a temporary rough patch",1

"tips to cope with chronic stress  my job is overwhelming and lately i have been stuck in a functional freeze shortly after i arrive it feels like every task i complete generates 5 more my boss is very dependent on me knowing what and how to do things so i function with very little oversight 

we semirecently added an additional employee who needs a lot of oversight and handholding it takes them far too long to finish tasks and they frequently forget how to do things i’ve mentioned how overwhelmed i am to my boss and she just tells me to give work to others this requires me to stop and take even more time to explain how to do it because the newish employee forgot our front office has several procedures in place like designated scanningfile clerk but my boss forgets or ignores our system which leads to things getting messed up by the newbie or missed 

i am on summer from school right now and am supposed to be studying for a licensing exam and writing a 10000 word thesis paper i can’t even take a lunch break to work on it without feeling completely overwhelmed by work i’m not sure how i’m going by to balance three nights of classes and preparing for the actual licensing exam with work next year 

i haven’t been able to stick to a diet plan because of stress eating while i’m mentally checked out so i keep gaining weight which messes with my psyche even more i’ve been trying to squeeze in light workouts but they don’t feel like i’m doing enough sitting at a desk 85 on work days and bouncing from desk to car to desk from 8am 1130 pm definitely feels demoralizing

i’m really considering discussing reducing my work hours to part time but then the financial stress kicks in when time is already scarce and i keep getting caught in functional freeze i feel like i cannot escape this spiral that keeps getting worse i’ve been experiencing more and more physical symptoms of stress that i know don’t help i’ve even tried to implement strict routines but find myself missing bedtime and waking up late

in life there is a time for everything to be born to admire everything beautiful that surrounds us to learn from our mistakes to cry and to smile the important thing is that we dont get ahead of ourselves and know how to wait for each of those moments  
no wind is favorable for those who do not know the port they want to arrive at  
he considers problems an inevitable part of life and repeats the most encouraging words there are this too shall pass

"anxious because i am not anxious i have health anxiety more specifically mental health anxiety it usually showcases itself as a constant fear of going nuts or developing schizophrenia psychosis etc 

when my anxiety subsides i get it again because as we know “crazy people don’t know or care whether they are going crazy” and that is what happens i just stop caring because my anxiety is down at the moment and then i start to think that i am actually developing some mental illness due to the fact that “i don’t care anymore”

is this normal i would really appreciate any advice

"how do i stop thinking about how my girlfriend hurt me i love my girlfriend i truly do we have been together for a long time but i get lots of anxiety attacks that i am trying to work through i am going to therapy reading articles and working on myself but nothing seems to help i dont want to break up with my girlfriend but i get frequent panic attacks and so sad on occasion

me and my girlfriend are in a healthy relationship we have lots of communication and we talk every day we make it an effort to chat and have a conversation every night last year i called my usual time and noticed she did not pick up she had texted she was watching television so i figured we could do our own thing i didnt think much of it we often have a few nights like that 

i figured she had went to sleep shortly thereafter when i called late the next day she texted me and didnt confess she had spoken to her ex 

i found out through a close friend and aide it broke me mentally physically and although this has been over sixmonths i still get anxiety depression and selfanguish i still have trauma thinking anytime she doesnt call late at night she could be speaking to an ex 

to her credit i should not have known but once i did shes made every effort to be more committed to me shes apologized been more communicative and worked with me shes given me time space and the energy to grieve shes reassured me and even gone backwards for me 

although i want to believe she is faithful loyal and transparent theres this little thing in the back of my mind that at any point in the day not even late at night now she could be talking to her ex it just eats at me and im reminded by how much it hurt

my girlfriend thought i was over it but i just hadnt brought it up because she asked me not to however id be lying if i didnt say the feelings still come up sometimes multiple times a day weekly or at random moments

i confessed that i still was dealing with the trauma and shes asked me not to bring it up since all i did for threeweeks straight was ask why did she do that shes apologized time and time again and even cut her exe out of her life

i know i need to fix my life

im relatively good academically or i was while i still cared about life and it just makes me more hopeless to know that i could actually have potential in the world if i could just care

i used to have so many interests but thats just gone out of the window i dont like or love anything or anyone anymore either

theres no way forward im just stuck and i often feel like im spectating life and watching everyone else fly past me and make something of their life

i hate myself and my life and my situation so much and then i also feel guilt for even having mental health problems because in theory my life is a really good situation

everyone in my family is basically perfect and genius so obviously they were all shocked when they realized i wasnt ok and my dad is basically still in denial

psychiatrist also said i should get evaluated for adhd but again my parents are in denial

ive been recommended to start meds for insomnia anxiety and depression asap but for some reason im terrified of any medication so that wont happen and the last time i tried talking therapy it made my situation worse

i also completely understand that there are people in way worse situations that me but i want to fix my life so that i can live up to peoples unreal expectations of me and actually be happy but basically at this point i see no point because the world is sick and corrupt and shitty

oh and throwaway i havent washed my hair in about 2 months and i feel disgusting but dont have the will to fix it

"what are your guys go tos for managing your health anxiety hey all 


for the most part im pretty new to this sub not new to having anxiety though thats for sure lol 

i have pretty roughhh health anxiety my mind constantly swirls with what ifs and assuming worst case scenarios about every possible symptom like for example a cough could be early lung cancer 

i am a 23 year old female and although i am young and in fairly healthy shape a bit overweight i do my due diligence in getting my yearly blood work done and getting a papsmear every 3 years so i try and tell myself that if i ended up with something such as cancer it would likely be caught early because im being responsible in keeping up with myself however it doesnt stop the heart pounding racing thoughts from coming in so for example i have to go get another pap done soon and i cant help but panic at the thought of what if my cervix cells come back abnormal and i do have cervical cancer and then just spiral out 

now i also know it is even worse on my immune system to be anxious and have anxiety about certain things so those of you with health anxiety what are your best ways of managing it and not having a heart that pounds out of your chest every time you go to the doctor thanks",1

i would work for a couple of hours in the morning go and stay with her for 89 hours then go back home and work for a couple of hours i was exhausted every single day then i was home for a week with her once she got discharged she has definitely lost some cognitiveness and is very frustrating to be around i left a week ago and she is on her own although i dont know how long that will last because she is getting more forgetful but refuses to have help come in i couldnt work that 3rd week because we are only allowed to work 2 weeks out of state so i had to apply for fmla and reduced pay for that week

i told my sister that if this happens again which i have no doubt something will happen in the next few months that she needs to go and deal with it i get an immediate nope not me im not going to spend days there i know its a hardship on you but im not doing it so now all i can think is in the next few weeks im going to have to fly out there again because i just know something is going to happen

"i thought getting a new job would make me happyit hasnt ive been stuck at the same minimum wage job for over a decade due to bad luck finding a job related to what i went to school for then i go to community college to learn programming only to find that the tech job market has crashed and burned for new people and so i made my final decision be more aggressive about full time job hunting for a few months and if that doesnt work enroll in trade school

a month ago i get hired to be an entry level calibration technician i was excited i was happy i could finally leave my minimum wage job for something with a bit more pay and a more consistent schedule and no more interaction with the general public its been a month of working there and i was hoping id be happier butim not im still gripped by massive amounts of anxiety im still anxious and scared about not knowing everything my coworkers have been friendly but i still feel very out of place since i barely know anything and everyone talks about things i have no clue about i also feel a strong sense of loneliness since everyone seems to know each other well but im way too damn shy and anxious to be more open i also keep asking myself what if i dont like doing this is this the best i can do ill likely wont get another chance getting a different job ever again

"having both burnout and urent tasks at the same time how to handle it title edit urgent tasks

how my burnout started

 in the past i was a super productive person i consistently scored very high grades and was capable of doing 70 hours of weekly productivity school job gym volunteering no free time easy feels good until it didnt
 this started 3 years ago i was starting my first year of uni and it was different than my expectation i started with super high motivation but that soon dropped when the mandatory subjects were not really what i was interested in learning the amount of homework was huge but at the same time i was also fighting my depression still am trying to manage my friendships which was not going well at all trying to fix other things in my life dealing with suicidal friends everything i had to deal with including but not limited to huge loads of homework it was more than i could handle a day only has 24 hours but it was like more than 24 hours of work every single day my stress levels were high and my grades were terrible my study coach told me i needed to quit atleast temporary because he saw it was simply too much for me deep inside i knew he was right but i was stubborn and wanted to prove myself
 a few weeks later it got worse and worse and then the grades came again which i scored terribly on and that was the point where i decided to just quit i emailed my uni saying i quit 2 years ago and then i was done now i was at the start of a reeeally long holiday with no plan b and no clue what to do with also very limited social life because i mostly only have online friends i rarely visit my real life friends due to them living 15 hours away now because ive been experiencing stress so intensely and finally made a huge decision to drop it all i was like time to relax and do whatever i want nothing else that soon turned into a 247 gaming addiction which wasnt good either

during the burnout at home period

 from 2 years ago until now i have not had a job and have not been studying again the first year was basically only being a game addict doing nothing to improve my life my energy was zero and so my productivity was also zero every time something important came up when i had to do something i just threw it on my todo list and then forgot about it ill do it some day in the future well thats why right now my todo list has hundreds of things on it some of them were truly important and urgent but i wasnt able to do them in time ive suffered the necessary consequences of that

now

 im still experiencing this burnout if i do something productive for 30 minutes or more my brain is fried for the rest of the day physically im also tired easily i really cannot handle much anymore but now there is an urgent problem the last 2 years i have been procrastinating alot of things alot some of them truly urgent and important i cannot ignore those else i will suffer the consequences of that again but i cant get shit done either my energy level is still fucking zero

so right now i have a 3 years old todo list alot of things on it are urgent and important and alot are probably too late by now but some are not i want to prevent that i miss out on urgent things again

my burnout does not allow me to get anything significant done

my todo list with some urgentimportant things does not allow me to take rest

i stand for a choice where no matter what i do the outcome is terrible help",1

"dream panic attacks i’ve had nightmares over the past couple of months where someone i know dies and i’m thrown into this uncontrollable emotional state full on crying not being able to breathe tight chested the whole works i would wake up and still have the sore chest from my nightmares and it has given me some fear and anxiety in real life that when i’m faced with something similar i’ll have that reaction all over again 

i brought up this to my therapist and she mentioned it sounded like i was experiencing a panic attack in my dream and that somethings triggering a response for it she did also assure me of steps i can take if i do ever run into a similar situation and also explained she’s a therapist not a dreamologyist so she can’t really say much on it lol

i guess i’m on here mainly asking if anyone’s experienced something similar or even just thoughts on the topic to me it doesn’t make sense that my dream self can have a panic attack 

i should note i’m not a very visible emotional person so i think losing control in my dream of my emotions is also a slight trigger for them if at all

a little about me i 23f graduated with an art degree almost a year ago i have been to counseling and therapy during college but quit once i got my current job i have been working at a daycare since august about 40 hours every week only reason i don’t quit is because i need to pay bills

i want to go get an alternative teaching certification in grades 612 math or science haven’t decided which subject yet like i did with my art and degree field i sort of lost passion idk for sure but this is the best way to put this i know i love to teach and work with kids but i am also very fearful and think “what if this isn’t what i want to do” i’m a very creative and somewhat social person so it wouldn’t be a nightmare

my parents lectured me saying that i need to get it together and that i’ve become so complacent with this terrible job and they won’t support me once i’m 26 i 100 agree with them but i’m worried that teaching may not be my calling or i’m doing this for the wrong reasons i feel stuck and thinking about my future regarding teaching or getting better sometimes terrifies me

"new annoying symptoms  hello everyone  
    
i would like to share an experience with you and see if anyone else is going through or has gone through the same problem  
  
i have enormous anxiety about health ever since i had a serious illness about 15 years ago because of this history i have to undergo periodic exams and with each new exam i suffer from fear and worry i feel that this wears me out a lot and disrupts my life  
    
in this process i often start having some physical symptoms that are always attributed to anxiety but i always believe almost always with an impressive certainty that i have a serious illness  
    
a few weeks ago i started feeling a tingling sensation in my big toe its not like numbness and loss of sensitivity its more like an internal vibration which spread and started affecting other random   
parts of my body jumping from limb to limb accompanied by muscle fasciculations generally mild but very annoying i notice that my reflexes are more active too as if my whole body is under an electric current  
    
im trying to keep my mind free from worries staying hydrated taking vitamins and everything else especially since i dont have health insurance at the moment and wouldnt want to pay for a medical appointment to once again be labeled a hypochondriac why is it so hard not to be worried

i can feel myself giving up
i’m losing track of time and all i do is whine

but if you pretend everythings fine it should turn out alright 
right but is pretending a solution when it’s just an act
yeha they say oh used to do this and that but i could care less about anything besides the fact
the fact that i’m not okay and the realization that even if i convince my head my body reminds that he is dead
that hair that drains at the bottom of my tub along with confidence that i once was
the feeling of confusion when i look outside and see it’s almost june and
when did those days pass by i can’t remember if i tried
so am i giving up or have i already i don’t know but i know my hands are still shaking the reminder that my heart still beats and that i’m turning into a shell of a human forgetting what’s underneath i’m just a girl blinded by delusion

im a us veteran and ive been going through a tough time since leaving the service three years ago recently ive mustered up the courage to start utilizing my benefits and seeking help from doctors

i visited a psychiatrist a couple of weeks ago and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder the doctor prescribed lexapro and recommended therapy which ill be starting soon its been a difficult journey managing my mental health while juggling school and work which eventually led me to quit my job even focusing on school has become overwhelming

on top of that ive lost touch with most of my friends and my roommates see me as a liability the trauma from my military service has been weighing heavily on me and ive struggled to process it until now

something’s that help me hi everyone just reaching out to tell everyone something’s that have helped me so far i’ve had some bad reactions this time around to some medication and it has been hell since december but it is slowly getting better something’s that helped me was for one getting a second opinion on my medication from a mental health urgent care clinic the psychiatrist on staff was super helpful and helped adjust my medication which helped so much like everyone i just went along with what my psychiatrist was doing because they are the professional other thing that has helped was get a new therapist i was finding that my previous therapist wasn’t helping and i stayed with them because i was looking for any hope at the time my new therapist listens and also is making a plan for me so that i can get back to my normal even working through trauma and giving me techniques to help with panic attacks and anxiety they explain things for me in a way that i can understand and makes sure that i am understanding i am currently reading a book “cptsd from surviving to thriving” and “overcoming intrusive thoughts” which has helped and explained certain things about trauma and the brain and how it is stored i think for anyone struggling reading or listening to that book will help i learned how the brain works with anxiety and panic attacks which has helped me understand that anxiety will try to look for any threat to make sense of the situation the body and mind is going through even though there isn’t necessarily a threat and if you think you’re going crazy remember that people who have mental health disorders do not know they have them and wouldn’t be looking for them that’s our brain trying to make sense of the invisible threat it will literally grasp for anything i was so afraid of hurting myself because the thought crossed my mind and scared me causing my ocd to kick in my anxietyocd took that thought and made it into the threat even though it was an intrusive thought we all have them and it’s normal to have those thoughts because they are just thoughts that pop up then leave seconds after i also put on meditation videos or sound baths on before i sleep to help calm me for a nights rest i know when we are in desperate need we tend to do listen and do anything to help even though it’s not helping and it’s okay that what we first hoped for didn’t work the first time like we hoped there is help for you out there don’t give up or settle things will get better and the feelings you are having will pass even when we think it won’t ,1

currently unemployed for almost half a year savings almost gone still paying rent abroad but still stuck between the two potential lives therefore slow with the jobs applications cherry of the top in a serious relationship with a person who i love but from different culture different religion and close to impossible future but love is blind isnt it or at least makes us blind most logical sounds to break up and go back home try to make it work there being with family better chance of finding someone similar for me for the future money money would come but yet i cannot do it my heart wouldnt let me and there is that longing for my abroad life as well what would it be what could it be but the doom that years are passing and i want to settle somewhere also is on my shoulders

"looking for psychiatrist in phoenix arizona area continuing care for  benzos  my dr  is mia  i’m looking for recommendations  in the phoenix valley area of highly recommended psychiatrists or prescribing physicians who is understanding about anxiety  panic attacks who prescribes  benzos  continuing care  this is not new   agreeing to it while you’re on pain meds dealing with debilitating chronic pain  

my psych decided to be mia and no response in 2 months and people are leaving reviews of the same  essentially leaving their patients behind to possibly have a seizure and die once their benzo script runs out which for me is in 18 days on july 12th  and it’s very hard finding a dr who is understanding  some consults i’ve had their licenses should be taken away  i’ve been on mine for 9 years daily and one told me  i’ll prescribe you spravato and go cold turkey  ummm are you looking for a malpractice suit  

 but how can they deny you when you’ve been on it for years and will literally have a seizure when there’s none left and leaving pain meds behind is not an option … it’s very overwhelming and would need to make a few consults or more to make sure i will be okay and i’ll ask my pcp but i doubt it’ll go well with them  

any suggestions would truly appreciate it  thank you ",1

"crippling relationship anxiety  i’m crippled in bed taking hydroxyzine because i’m anxious about my relationship it’s been a bit rocky lately so i am overthinking everything he flew out last night for work and i say things like “let me know when you land i love you” and he doesn’t say love you too then i say “goodnight i love you” and he doesn’t say love you too then i just put “i loveeeee youuuu” to try and get him to respond to it… no response but he did message in a group chat we are both in so i know he was awake 

he was traveling and it was late so it could be he just didn’t think about it but now i can’t bring myself to text him first today cause i need him to respond to my “i love you” text i don’t know how to calm myself he’s now 3 hours behind timeline wise so i’m going to be waiting all morning for him to text

"i need help 

i’m really struggling i am watching my boyfriend go from having quit smoking to buying pack after pack i have generalized anxiety disorder  which yes requires me to put in extra effort so as not to micromanage he has told me in the past that when i used to text him about it it made him want to smoke even more than when i don’t text him about my feelings i’ve been journalling for two weeks straight and i don’t think there’s a single entry where i haven’t mentioned his smoking i’ve been trying to journal instead of talking to him about it it bothers me all the time i don’t want to watch him get addicted he says “it’s my body”  and yes it is his but we’re also in this together hard for my anxiety not to associate him going down this path with him throwing away his plans for a healthy future

he says he hears me but a month ago he told me when he started his new job he wanted to quit smoking build a home gym build healthy habits here we are and i get triggered by everything tv shows where characters smoke nonstop living in a small village where smoking is the culture seeing cigarette butts on the ground seeing his pack of cigarettes get lower and lower 

i don’t mean to just vent on here  i genuinely want to know if anyone has any tips on how to best go about the situation any tips on coping with a partner who you can’t talk to about their smoking he knows my thoughts on it  but he disregards how unhealthy it is

"does the anxiety from weed ever go away i first started smoking maybe last summer i smoked every other day pretty much just with carts and didn’t really have many panic attacks or have any anxiety like i over did it i struggled with enetmophobia fear of throwing up so sometimes i got scared that i would green out and throw up so that’s why i got anxious sometimes but it really wasn’t that bad my senior started and i would only smoke maybe once or twice a week nothing much i would probably take like 3 hits max and just stopso up to this point i’ve had a couple panic attacks but pretty mild and only while i’m high but something happend 4 months ago in february 

me and my buddies went to a basketball game and decided to all take edibles after about an hour i realized i 100 took way too much it was like 100mg of th9 which i thought sounded like a lot but my friend told me i should be fine i got hit with a hardddd ass panic attack i went to the bathroom mid game heart palpitations dizzy short breaths sweaty confused just panicking mostly because i knew it wasn’t going to go away for hours and that hit me hard you’d think after this experience i’d never want to do weed again but for whatever reason the feeling of when i finally calmed down after like 2 hours of panicking off this 100mg and then felt sooo good like just relaxed zoned out a little bit thrown off with what happend i then decided to buy 6 30 mg th8 gummies very next day my dumbass takes 30 mg of d8 edible the panick attack was even worse then day before i just remember being butt naked in my shower literally like spasing out basically shaking heart unbelievably fast frantically trying to find anything that will calm me down tea  melatonin reading talking to people the only thing that ever helped my panick attacks were a warm shower but it didn’t really help this time because it was really bad i didn’t know if i was scared i was going to throw up or if i was panicking because i got too high 

i guess 30 mg of d8 is a lot for a newbie i tried lowering the doses over the next few days and i semi panicked a couple more times but i got through 180 mg of d8 in like 8 days my first day off the edibles  i had insomnia which i figured is pretty normal because i just did edibles like 10 days inna row and it was usually like 3 hours before bed i would take them so first night off i just had some cold sweats and insomnia the next night was one of the most miserable experiences off my life that would carry on for a week for like 9 days straight  didn’t sleep until 430 am bad panic attacks nausea tight like feeling in chest cold sweats loss of appetite shaking crazy depression i started to get anxiety during my day everywhere  i couldn’t finish my lifts because my heart would beat like crazy and i’d get really dizzy and scared the symptoms got a little better after 1015 days and slowly subsided over like another month especially at night 

since the withdrawals from those edibles started i’ve maybe had around 100150 panick attacks roughly the last 2 months i’ve gotten better from end of feb to end of april i had insomnia it got to this 
point where i was getting anxiety about not getting enough sleep and it was this never ending cycle of not falling asleep and getting anxiety and then feeling like shit then when i don’t get sleep it’s hard for me to eat and i get more anxiety because i have low energy i tried everythingggg for sleeping besides for actual meds i didn’t want to use them melatonin would help the panic attacks at night but usually wouldn’t get me to fall asleep biggest thing that helped was just getting a set schedule and putting my phone away like 2030 min before sleep i know i’ve just yapped like crazy but that’s pretty much been my story with this weed and anxiety up until now

my problem now is that i don’t know when i’m nervous or excited these emotions don’t exist for me anymore because i just think it’s anxiety fucking with my head again i’ve had maybe 12 panic attacks this june and had like 3 in may so it’s getting better but i just hate this constant anxiety i still get i’ve learned to deal with the panic attacks i’ve read a lot of different peoples experiences which was really helpful to know you’re not alone sometimes i did this online therapy thing for a bit but i stopped after 2 weeks because i just didn’t really like it and the guy diagnosed me with ocd after 2 one hour sessions i don’t know if there’s a name for this but i’ve kind of figured out what triggers my anxiety it’s whenever i feel like i’m enclosed in some kind of time frame like for example when i take pre workout i know it’s gonna last in my body for like an hour so know my anxiety is high during this hour because i know there’s nothing in my power i can to make myself go back to normal another example is cars and planes mainly planes i know i’m in some box in the sky for 3 hours and that there’s nothing i can do to be back on the ground i start panicking because there’s nothing i can do ubers are really bad especially when im with other people i can’t just hop out whenever and have to sit with this anxiety of again not being able to do anything i don’t know the name of this but it sucks and idk if i have to go to a therapist or figure it out 

alright i know i’ve kind of been yapping and saying random shit but i’m just wondering if there’s any one else out there that could kind of relate to what i’ve been through and if this anxiety will ever go away i’m an over thinking type of person already but i never used to have panic attacks or insomnia for weeksmonths i’ve been a lot better this past month compared to hell earlier in the year i smoked a couple puffs of a j like a month ago for a special occasion and i was too drunk to really panic other than that i have cut off weed completely ",1
"perception of stress affecting its impact on health hey

so ive read the upside of stress and this research article  

and it all points out to the fact that our perception of stress is the thing contributing to its adverse effects  
but why do we have those perceptions in the first place

i dont think stress did absolutely nothing to humanity until we heard that its bad for us  
can it be that were misattributing cause and effect  
that is some types of stress are perceived as good  caring for a loved one doing something really hard that we care about like being a doctor working overtime whereas other types  working 12 hours a day at a deadend job is stress we perceive as bad and so it hurts us more

"can ha be caused by emotional neglect as a child whenever i had a health concern as a child my parents would just brush it off and tell me i was being dramatic

i feel like the lack of acknowledgement or support could have caused me to develop hyper vigilance around health symptoms as a coping mechanism

idk how to explain it but the anxiety of not being supported by my parents made me feel like i had to do it all alone 

i didn’t want to be caught off guard so i had to be suspicious of every symptom and stay prepared for disaster by catching it early

maybe the real reason we don’t feel safe is because our parents never showed us we could rely on them to keep us safe

the denial of our worries made them feel huge and unmanageable because even our parents couldn’t fix them

the diseases don’t trigger me as much as the feeling of helplessness does

"i need some advice on the way i feel about living with my dad i think i have some sort of mental health anxiety problem that i cant make sense of when im at home i absolutely hate being perceived by anyone

for a bit of context im 24f and have had my own place since i was 19 at some point when i was 20 my dad had moved in with me bc him and his gf split up and he had nowhere to go we didnt have the best relationship when i was a kid bc my family life was really complicated but now im an adult we get along really well and we both love each other so much out of all of my siblings i would say im the closest to him and relate the most too

at the start i loved having him stay with me hed give a small bit of money to help with bills and only really stayed on weekends since his job required him to stay out during the week but since february 2023 he lost his job and has now been at my place 247 and its so draining he stopped giving me money which i never really cared about but its the fact that he doesnt help me do anything around the flat he doesnt cook and he doesnt clean i feel like im constantly tidying up after him i have a small one bed flat and so he sleeps on my sofa in the living room which parts off into my kitchen i found myself feeling like a prisoner in my own home im an introverted person and so i spend most of my time enjoying being alone when im not in work  but its gotten to the point where i will stay in my bedroom all day just to avoid seeing my dad i have no problems with him whatsoever and theres never any tension between us 

i feel like i cant do anything when hes around simply because i dont like being percieved when im doing tasks i feel like i cant clean my place i cant make dinner and i cant even shower when hes here bc it somehow makes me uncomfortable although im perfectly happy to do these things if hes sleeping its so strange but i dont understand why i feel this way there are times where ill cook for the both of us for dinner but if i wanted a quick bite then id feel uncomfortable going to the kitchen to make something bc hed be in my presence it gets to the point where i wont even allow myself to get up and pee when i need to i have to mentally force myself to do so i know to most people this would seem so silly and theres literally nothing stopping me from doing the tasks that i want but for me there is i know its my own problem and nothing to do with my dad at all  hes super lovely to me i dont have any fear or uncertainty towards him

its getting really exhausting and slowly starting to make me hate him being here i feel like hes taken over my space and thats its not actually my place but his i start to feel resentment towards him being here when i can hear him getting a glass of water or going to the bathroom when i cant do these simple things i hate that i spend all my time in my bedroom and feel like a cant use the other rooms in my place

i know its a really weird issue i have but does anyone have any advice or have ever felt anything similar

"how to identify chronic stress been having digestive issues for awhile now 6 months and tests scan colonoscopy didnt really identify any culprit they did discover some diverticula unusual for my age but the doc considered it to be a consequence rather than a cause for my issues 

ever since ive been trying by myself to find the cause keeping a food journal upping fiber and doing more exercise but sadly to no avail lately ive been considering whether it might be stressrelated i have been self employed for a couple of years now and there is always a level of uncertainty involved with that i do find myself to occasionally struggle with patience a feeling of restlessness and difficult to cut off 

i havent had a vacation in years and there are days where i feel like my brain battery is empty but overall i did never really consider it as abnormal nor do i have a strong urge to take a vacation lately i also noticed unconscious jaw clenching especially at night i do usually fall asleep fast and sleep through but i do have the feeling of sleeping with tension as i do tend to have a stiff neck or back when i wake up 

so i guess my question is how do i know if there is an abnormal level of chronic stress are there certain routines i could try to assess improvements over a prolonged period i was considering to take an ashwaganda supplement since ive heard positive things about it

"feeling sick is it just stress hello everyone

back in september i suddenly started to feel ill with many different symptoms it didnt go away for months

after many tests all coming back normal and visits i noticed some patterns feeling better after visiting the doctor even though he didnt help me in any way i concentrated on stress management techniques and assumed that all my symptoms were caused by stress

after just one week i felt almost completely well this was in february

since then i have changed a lot of things in my life become more active talked to a psychiatrist gone to therapy etc

the thing is that i still have some symptoms and do not feel 100 well

1 lower abdomenstomach area i feel a slight sharp pain sometimes on the left sometimes in the middle as if someone is poking me with a pen from inside
2 pain in the left side of my neck from my shoulder to my ear

i have tried antiinflammatory cream stretching changing diet but it is still there

is it possible that it is still caused by stress stress that is so much a part of my daily life that i am not even aware of it but it is still somewhere inside me

also even though i feel much better after assuming that me feeling ill is caused by stress its still strange to me that ive fell ill so quickly back in september instead of it being more of a gradual change into illness

"nervous system retraining programs hi all  
i wont go too deep into my story but ive been chronically stressed and anxious most of my life and i suspect a big part of this has to do with an overactive sympathetic nervous system due to some childhood experiences

does anyone have experience with one of these programs and did it help you reduce anxiety and chronic stress longterm there is something about them that screams scam but at the same time i am intrigued one red flag is that they always want hundreds of dollars to teach you these sciencebacked techniques

ive struggled with health anxiety for many years now and its been massively affecting my daily life as im sure many of you have also experienced i cant really afford therapy  honestly dont have the time to schedule sessions i have a crazy work schedule so ive been looking into alternatives   
  
to my surprise ive had some amazing success with ai therapy chatbots theyre available 247 so when youre feeling an anxietypanic attack coming on you can literally just open your phone and talk to someone such a game changer for me personally—i havent felt this free and supported in a while   
to anyone else whos considering trying them out i would highly highly recommend giving it a shot  

i personally love sonia at the moment but also have some experience with a couple others pi woebot generic chatbots happy to elaborate or chat more indepth with anyone who may be interested otherwise just wanted to share my experience here and spread happinesshelp to all who may need it  3 ",1
"how to deal with death anxiety this is an alt account i am male

i’ve never really feared death or had problems with it in fact tw  i survived an attempt on my life just under 2 years ago  and i don’t really know what changed but a couple days ago my mind went crazy over the idea of it not that death is unknown or nothing but rather the fact that it will happen and i don’t know when it’ll happen

i think most of my life has been spent mostly avoiding life or simply breathing or sleeping just to pass the day if that makes sense i don’t attach much meaning or worthiness to it and maybe that’s why i’m suddenly feeling a change towards my attitudes i’m sort of scared that i can barely remember what happened between now and two years ago and it felt like no time at all and maybe i will experience the same thing from now and 55 odd years in the future if i am to die of old age i hope that makes sense i’m really scared i will somehow kill the time between now and death doing nothing memorable or meanwhile that the ‘gap’ that feels like nothing between this summer and last summer will somehow extend to the entirety of life

i think a better way i can describe it is like how some days you wake up and somehow in a blink of an eye it’s 11pm and you’re going to sleep where did the time go 

i don’t know if this all sounds really stupid or it isn’t anxiety or actually i’m just going crazy and it isn’t really real or something like that i just would really appreciate advice to help get over the fact one day i will be old and deal with the fact i could die at any moment im really sorry if this sort of post is unwanted im just really irked by this and i don’t know where or what or who to turn to and it’s consumed me for days thank you if you read this",1

"root causes of anxiety and depression i am a year removed from a hospitalization for severe anxietydepression with suicidal ideation  i am on some serious medication daily  300mg of seroquil 150 mg of sertraline 2 mg ativan 200 mg of bupropion

it is a real bitch to wake up in the morning and get going after my nightly seroquel dosebut it does help with sleep  in the morning i feel like absolute shit and usually take 2 mg of ativan to start the day so i can substitute teach

i have made some serious strides over the past few months as there was a time me when i did not think i could work full time
i try to exercise most days eat right get enough drugged sleep

problem is that the medication has only slightly helped the situation and i still have anxietydepression and occasional sleep problems

yesterday i told my wife that my anxietydistress ratchets up when she and my 10 month old daughter come home  and it’s always worse in the weekend when we are all home together probably not something she wanted to hear but it is the truth  

i would love to be able to have relaxed conversationsinteractions with my wife and daughter but many times i end up in freeze mode where i don’t want to move which makes it hard to do anythingincluding just talking thinking or being there in the present moment

i would love to resolve this issue and not be anxious around them but this has been going on for about a year  i told my therapist that at this point it’s like a pavlovian responsejust happens  

i guess i have a few questions regarding the situation  first and foremost is there any way to alleviate or eliminate this response  or is my best option getting a place of my own and heal there  i don’t know what to do but it’s been going on a long time  i don’t want to abandon my wife and kid but is that the only viable option i have to start feeling better any suggestionscommentssimilar stories would provide some relief or at least a little distraction thx",1

im 27m  currently stuck in a job which i dont like to be frank its not the job that is the issue more with co workers upper management etc all my life i have been considered a hard worker to be frank while i was in college or previous jobs etc i was able to and used to work 10x more and handle much more stress than this  compared to then i know the job is easier and pays more only the thing is at my workplace im the only one who is shouldering all the responsibilities  i know i sound condescending to just as i type this  but it really is the case here its like the management  my superiors know that they cant get my colleagues to get these responsibilities done so they have just dumped all the difficult work on me whereas for the rest of them its almost like they get paid for sitting and seeing phones from 94 as many times ive asked them to reduce my workload or put these on a more rotational basis all they say is after this month  or currently i cant change and stuff like that so im stuck on the fence about what to do next should i resign because with the current job market not sure if i get another job so easily or at least pays well in the main city i like  also even though its stressful its not like i cant handle the job tbf sometimes i feel even  if i was the only employee here i could still manage to get all the work done its just that this stress or frustration or anger or idk what it is thats been building up inside me because of this unfair division of work has been eating me up  am i becoming toxic   like lately after coming back home from work  i have to travel a long distance i just keep contemplating wether i should continue or resign and end up not doing anything else somedays i dont even feel like eating anymore  have like only one or two meals in the entire day sleep issues i already had and have exaggerated lately i tried talking to my parents about it  kind of have a strained relationship with them and they just say if youre unhappy quit but like its not that easy right i have a girlfriend shes much more  career oriented than me  like one of those type a workaholic people  whenever i tried to discuss this with her shes always said whatever you do ill support you i mean i get that but i dont know whats the right thing to do here

"swollen thought visualisation prior to sleeping leading to messed up sleep lately i’ve been experiencing this every time i lay down to sleep it’s either going to sound plain strange or this is something people just go through and i simply didn’t get the memo so here goes my account

the moment i close my eyes with the intention to sleep i start reflexively visualising my thoughts as ‘blobs’ floating on the back of my lids it starts off somewhat like how eye floaters work you know those strands that move with your field of vision no specific thought stands out per se but there’s an intrinsic knowledge that these are my thoughts and that i’m going to need to ignore them if i want to catch any rest 

seems normal enough but there’s been a frequenting development as of late these ‘blobs’ visually start filling up the entire space at a rapid pace picture twisty balloons expanding and swelling up with water and squishing against each other and the sides of a huge container all threatening to burst it sounds somewhat silly but man it’s a terrifying sensation especially when the ‘container’ is my actual visual mind it’s somewhat similar to that sensation of falling through air when you’re about to drift off but at least that’s a sharp sudden sensation—this is more of an inevitable buildup looming closer and growing larger and taking up all the space in your head 

it’s not a oncepernight occurrence either if it happens it’ll keep happening every time you close your eyes to try to sleep the only way out seems to be just tiring myself out enough that i crash course my way to the dreamworld haha 

anyone else going through similar experiences i’m so curious

"any tips for relationship anxiety 
i’ve been dating my boyfriend for 5 months and i was mentally okay no anxiety but still low self esteem until i started dating him and i’ve been suffering severely since then

 won’t go out to social situations
 using alcohol to cope
 only ever meeting up with him
 general feeling of dread and sickness in my stomach
 heart rate increase breathing panic attacks
 self hate and can’t stand to look at myself

i get completely obsessive and only think of them all dayfor hours every single day to the point it’s weird and stalkery i get so jealous and in my head that i’m not good enough for them and that they don’t actually love me  i’m so full of emotion and love so hard that it physically hurts me

i dated someone in the past and i was the exact same whilst dating them i was obsessed with them for 2 years they cheated 3 times  i kept going back because of my low self esteem  so that may have affected me as well

i’ve been crying everyday especially thinking about his ex comparing myself to her as i feel inferior to most girls because i hate myself  i’m called pretty by most people but i think it’s just all the makeup i wear giving that illusion so i haven’t let him see me without it in fear he’ll see me how i see myself

 i

 i been prescribed abilify 25 mg and i’m terrified of side effects shall i order pramipexole instead

basically my problems are possible asperger’s severe anxiety and anhedonic atypical depression adhd slight ocd and intrusive thoughts i’m just coming of trintellix since it didn’t help me at all my shrink suggested augmentation sertraline 25 mg  abilify 25 mg however when i check the list of side effects so abilify i became terrified the risk for diabetes is 1 in 10 people so it’s very high also there is risk of blood clots and risk of stroke and sudden unexplained death not even talking about possible tardive dyskinesia at this point is it worth it
are these side effects only for high doses  are they dose related 

abilify supposed to help me with intrusive thoughts and help balance my dopamine i guess and counter seri side effects should i jussi order pramipexole online for myself  at least with pramipexole i didn’t see a risk for sudden death  diabetes and so on so is it possibly safer than abilify 

i’m 23 year old male in good shape  62 ft and 208 lbs  checked all blood and in ranger  normal prolactin ecg fine except for incomplete right bundle bunch block and some qrs fragmentation which docs not concerned about i also have hyper pots but otherwise i’m healthy 

my anhedonia been very bad for the last 34 years and anxiety as well i been off work for a year and just living off my spending right now i tried sertralone before which was quite effective for anxiety but bad for anhedonia and adhd citalopram bupropion buspirone  prozac  moclobemide  trintellix  venlafaxine  had all eaitger partial response or failed completely  atm on pregabalon which helps with mood and anxiety and also anhedonia and motivation a bit but sooner or later it will lose efficacy and also i’m stilll lazy af without motivation and just feeling worthless all the time and like i’m a burden and dissapointmemt to my family

"scared of melanoma 

so i have this atypical mole on my right leg for as long as i can remember honestly it is pretty big and weird shape but i have never had issues with it today i looked at it for fun but idk if it is just my imagination or it got a bit darker not black but brown before it was light brown now as a person with health anxiety i immediantely thought of bad things but then again it seems a bit dumb because shape hasnt changed at least i think so and i think it is a bit dumb to be concerned esp because i dont have any family history of melanoma or any other skin cancers 

my question is does anyone else have similar things like atypical moles that changed color over time could it be due to sun exposure",1

"sharing my childhood trauma for help 
24m hi everyone i want to share my childhood trauma with you with hopes of gaining some insights on how to cure it or at least finding someone who can relate

i was 10 when my parents sent me and my 6 yo brother to a summer soccer camp for 10 days i remember going there with a very happy face and i really enjoyed the first day and night there but on the second day my brother came to me crying out loud and visibly sad and disturbed saying that he missed our parents and that he wanted to go home i dont know what happened in that moment but something broke inside me and i experienced a massive panic attack which i tried to repress trying to make my brother feel safe but i couldnt handle it and sunk myself into a state of constant and acute anxiety needing to cry every second and being a 10 yo not understanding such a painful feeling those next 9 days were the longest of my life counting every second to go back home the hardest part was keeping a smile on my face and trying to confort my little brother while being destroyed on the inside definitely not a role which a 10 yo should assume

i havent been the same ever since my theory is that such a massive panic attack and a sustained acute anxiety for 9 days as a kid changed my brain chem forever and i have never been able to fully enjoy life ever since i ended up normalizing having trauma general anxiety disorder as well as disthymic disorder 

although i usually end up enduring them through a lot of pain and anxiety i have never been able to peacefully confront situations with similar patterns ever since going on trips with school traveling alone facing the first day of a new job in the spirit of facing this trauma two summers ago i went abroad for a month to volunteer in a farm but the first day i arrived there i experienced again such a massive panic attack and anxiety that i drove the 12 hours back to my house immediately feels very frustrating at the very least and impedes me to find a job i also need to say that of course i dont blame my brother nor my parents for this i am sure that if they would have felt what i was feeling they would have pulled us out of there immediately

i am currently starting on meds im also starting on therapy and i will try to selfadminister emdr can anyone give some tips or insight on this trauma thanks for reading

"feeling overwhelmed it takes more to overwhelm some people than others but the feeling and the impact are the same overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety  
  
take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again  
  
identify what you can and can’t control list your issues in three columns what you can control what you can influence and what is outwith your control for each item in the first two columns reflect on how you would like that situation to be instead and what small step you can take to achieve that  
  
focus on solutions now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control and the endpoint for each issue shift your focus from the problems to the solutions  
  
prioritise your actions consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are firstly deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues as a general rule deal with the important issues over the urgent issues herein lies the path to living sustainably crisis free  
  
communicate with your plan in place communicate with those who may be affected it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation  
  
eat well overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or overreliance on junk food buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game  
  
gratitude it is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for that you’re taking control of challenging situations that you’re on your way to calmer times that you’re learning a lot about yourself perhaps that others are supporting you  
  
blow off some steam exercise – whatever works best for you a brisk walk hit the weights an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and reset all those neurotransmitters it will also help you get that good night’s sleep  
  
get your rest know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan you’re pushing yourself hard through the day a good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list    
  
  
celebrate your successes each step forward is worthy of celebration be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward each success leads to further steps forward  
  
  
  
overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with short term episodes are unlikely to harm us longer term however it can be debilitating remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things

i dont know what to do so i suffer from really bad anxiety and depression and one thing that has been helping is my job at a restaurant where i live i work for 2 hours 2 days out of the week and get paid 850 an hour and its the only reason ive been taking showers but last year in august i had to move back in with my crappy parents because i was living with my brother and his boss was being a huge dick and he wants me to get ssi because he wants me t somehow pay him 200 when i physically cant but i know when i get ssi im going to want to quit going to quit my job because i know im going to think whats the point of having this job and ssi but then i know my brothers bss is going to get pissed if i quit my job so im just feeling so tired stressed out and depressed about this situation,1
"i cant get out of bed i non binary biologically female 22 dont know how to explain it properly i find it difficult to wake up and then i cant get out of bed its as if my body was semi paralyzed it gets hard to breath and to speak and i just keep scrolling in my phone even if i am hungry i cant get up to eat sometimes i need to go to the bathroom and i cant do it either i cant think properly my mind is taking my prisoner

i suffer from anxiety i was depressed i dont know if im still depressed i also think i am autistic and my psychologist is writing something similar to a diagnostic for mealthough it isnt official because an official one must come from the the social security and wait lists are horrible

sometimes during the day i get so anxious that my body does get paralyzed for an indefinite amount of time it can happen anywhere and anytime sometimes it goes like this for 10 minutes sometimes half an hour sometimes more

sometimes i think maybe i am not autistic maybe i am just horrible at being a human im not asking for a diagnosis i am trying to get one although i sometimes doubt myself

"recently found a bracelet that helps my panic attacks and wanted to share  found something helpful with panic and wanted to share 

i’ve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for about 20 years the most helpful thing my psychiatrist told me to do when i start to feel a panic attack coming on is to hold a piece of ice in my hand and squeeze it or put ice on my chest outside of medications that suppress the panic attacks this has been the most helpful 

i was recently shown a really awesome bracelet called embr wave 2 it looks just like a smart watch and it sends a wave of warm or cold to help give relief during hot flashes or keep you warmcold as needed however i’ve found it to be very effective for me when i feel panic just turn it on with waves of ice cold and it immediately kind of “shocks” for a lack of better words my body so i forget about the panic and it puts my focus on the cold sensation on my wrist effectively preventing the panic attack or give me enough time to start breathing through it 

it is a bit pricey roughly 300 but i’ve been able to find it on sale sometimes and with amazon sales and black friday not too terribly far away maybe it’s something you can keep an eye on for the price to decrease 

just wanted to share and hope that others can find it as helpful as i did  

edit for fellow americans it is fsahsa eligible",1

"which med helped you being more sociabletalkative i suffer from depression and social anxiety since i can think diagnosed since i was 15 i already tried many different meds as well as therapies but still nothing was able to get my symptoms into control or make me functional 

social anxiety is the biggest issue as it‘s additionally the main cause of my depression 

just thinking about the next days or years makes me depressed because of the thoughts how to get through that social event that chat with a friend that meeting that career path that romantic relationship and so on because everything has socializing in it 

socializing affects every aspect of life my brain chemistry hinders me in every aspect of socializing making me very restricted being aware of these restrictions in every aspect of life career love life friendships sports hobbies passions etc makes me very depressed depression again feeds the social anxiety by zero energy motivation drive anhedonia and so on

what meds helped you the most with being better in socializing and also having more fun and drive to do so 

please be aware that i already tried following ones
 2 analytical depth psychological therapies
 1 cognitive behavioral therapy
 ssrisnris escitalopram venlafaxine sertraline paroxetine duloxetine
 dnri bupropion
 neuroleptics promethazine quetiapine
 tricyclic amitriptyline
 maoi moclobemide
 benzos diazepam lorazepam
 gabapentinoids gabapentin pregabalin
 others mirtazapine opipramol hydroxyzine

all were without any success in symptoms except for pregabalin but it‘s still not helping 100 or making life bearable  aside i don‘t think you can use that daily anyways

would love to read about your experiences and success with meds for sociability when suffering from depression and social anxiety or any other conditions

"extreme dress making me sick this is going to be long but i really need to vent and heal myself just constantly been hit with a series of traumatic events back to back and have been falling chronically sick and i’m sick of it 

to make it easier  i’m going to list down down whatever has happened in my life since 2018 and maybe i can have some help from all of you telling me and validating that it’s been a lot and whatever i’m feeling now  the health issues  chronic sickness  anxiety  depression  is a result of all these years of stress 

a bit about my background  so i come from a well to do family where i grew up with a comfortable life i’m also a type a go getter personality so i’ve gone to a top college and topped high school i’ve been hardworking all my life but we come from a background where all needs were more than taken care of for generations to come 

1 when i was in 11th grade  my dad got arrested for financial fraud  that was a big thing in high school but now when i look back  i don’t even know how i would have coped with that i don’t remember that phase of my life at all i thought i coped with it well but ofcourse the state i am in now  15 years later  i can see signs of how that would have impacted me and made me anxious 

post this my dad got out in one month and never made it seem like we had issues again he didn’t prepare us to tell us that we were going bankerupt 

2 cut to 2018 we go bankerupt and when i mean bankerupt  it’s literally 0 money in our family of 4 in all our accounts  you can imagine the shock 

3 at the same time my best friend passed away in front of me  fully catching fire in a freak incident where it was just two of us 

4 suddenly my parents have no choice but to ask me for money to run the house even though they didn’t want to but they had no choice 

5 i don’t have a problem to help out but i wasn’t prepeared and the hardworking person i am  i took up 23 jobs to help out 

6 with no money in the account and with barely any help in the house  my dad takes a loan to get my older brother married and has a big fat wedding for him 

7 i was dating a guy for 3 years who i end the relationship with because it was going no where and i have multiple guys meeting me over the next 3 years till  today  where side by side i’ve been working hard to get myself some stability financially 

8 i’ve met about 34 men who have dated me for three months each  and dumped me  i feel that they’ve dumped me because of what my family has gone through and it’s really affected my self worth and self esteem 

i now feel alone and sick 


 i’ve had a super stressful 3 years of my life and started getting constipated last year during the summer of 2022 on a two month trip to london

i’ve never had digestion issues before this but started getting constipated and really really hard and painful poops which started bleeding 

i have severe health anxiety so you can imagine the anxiety i got on top of all the stress i’ve been going through 

i went to my doctor and he told me it’s a fissure and it’s nothing to worry about 

this was in 2022 i never went back to him in 2023 because he told me to stop stressing out but i get constipated every 2  3 months with a bit of blood 

it’s causing me a pix of anxiety the whole day and i’m unable to get out for a single night with my friends to drink without feeling like it’ll hurt me the next day 

i’m taking a sena stool softener whenever i’m constipated and it helps me to go properly the next day without too much pain and no blood 

the cycle continues where i’m fine for a month or two and the constipation and following anxiety comes back 

i’m so scared i have stomach cancer or something but going back to the doctor again and again for reassurance is also something i can’t do 

i just need a break now and i want to feel better 
not constantly sick and unwell and thinking i’m dying of cancer i really need some mental peace and reassurance as i’ve thought i’ve had some kind of cancer all day everyday for more than a year or two and this is while i’m working really hard and trying to remove some chaos for my life my stomach just dosent help and i keep thinking i have a severe disease 
my blood tests were all completely normal so i don’t undersnd why my stomach just can’t behave 

before this stomach issue cropped up i was extremely regular with my work outs even though stressors existed the one thing that helped me cope ever since i’ve started getting constipated  i’m fatigued  can’t do anything and it’s a vicious cycle 

i just want to be better

"is it stress okay so yesterday i randomly got a sharp pain on the rightside of my chest above my breastbone and i didnt think anything of it i figured it was just heartburn and it would go away but my chest felt tight and tingly the rest of the night then i did start to feel a sense of fear and increased heartbeat but i was able to calm myself down so that only lasted around 3 minutes i ended up taking alkaseltzer before bed and it did go away and i was able to sleep but when i woke up i felt anxious and ive been feeling light sharp pains in my chest area again  
to conclude my heart rate and pressure is normal no pain when breathing in or out its just the random sharp pains for me on my chest and my upper abdomen at times i also noticed my appetite decreased  
ive gone to the hospital before for panic attacks but this is new to me and i really dont wanna go back lol please someone let me know if its just anxiety or stress and that im not dying

"super stressful summer weird sensations had a super stressful summer huge business got started was working for over 10 hrs a day also had a part time job and also had summer school i had no summer break and school just started 

a month ago i started having this weird itch  feeling that i had something touching me or something on my fingers then i started thinking i had carpal tunnel because of a bit of tingling and dull pains in fingers i also do pull ups and push ups so its either that or rsi

but fast forward it gets better when i stop thinking about it then i start feeling a slight burnwarmthweird feeling in the tip of my finger i google stuff and see people saying it happens in feet too and stuff and keep in mind nothing in any other limb but hands before that and i kid you not the next day i started feeling stuff in feetlegs then i read about face too and i started feeling stuff around the lips i have had no numbness anywhere no trouble balancing nothing no tingles in legs  face just weird burnsensation that someones scratching me idk what it is and i just get more worried 

feel like the worrying is making it worse

i also dont sleep a lot or eat well had an issue this summer where i would sleep at 1 and wake up at 6 i also eat very little this is just how i am though not recent

also i feel as if it happens only when i think about it or when i am not focused on anything if im hanging out with friends or busy at school i wont feel a thing if im alone in my room with my phone in my hand or something it hits me like crazy 

no bad or sharp pains so far no pains anywhere but the hand and fingers and no pains when moving joints or anything again nothing to make me think its ms or anything like that i do have lower back pain but that came months before any of the sensations and my lower back pain can be described more as discomfort than pain because its not really sharp pain or anything my mom used to have stomach problems due to stress and ive imagined sensations before once for 3 months i felt as if ive had something in the back of my throat till i went to the doctor he said i probably had nothing and it went away by itself

nothing really gives me an explanation why all of this is happening but i wish it did",1

i just experienced my first something  hello… i’m still iffy about the situation but i’m coming here to try and figure out what i just experienced i come from a home where mental health isn’t a thing so my whole life i just look past mental health and din’t pay mind to it today around 4 am i had to let someone go for the better however anytime i read anything about that person leaving or something involving leaving i would just cry i knew i was too attached to this person and i had to let go but every time i think of that my eyes get watery for the past week me and this person developed a cool relationship and had a lot of respect for each other so much that we would lose sleep and cancel shifts to talk longer i decided to back off not entirely but for the most part today i was crying saying sorry over and over again when eventually i froze up my hands got numb my anklekneeships every joint on my body felt locked i felt light headed but still could read text and my typing became really really slow… what should i call this reaction and since it happened once is it bound to happen again ,1
"desperate public speaking some venting it’s getting to the point where it’s controlling my life i have the worst public speaking anxiety probably in the world i’m being 100 serious so many people say how they are “oh so nervous to present” but they still get through it only their voice was “so shaky” and their “palms were so sweaty oh it’s the worst”

guys if i so much as think about getting up to talk in front of my peers in my classroom i am fully convinced i will die when i tell you my heart races beats out of my chest my mind is searching for every and any possible way to get out i’ve made some crazy excuses these past 5 years it’s exhausting i have so many other responsibilities in my life and this amplifies everything else’s difficulty by 10x it’s unsustainable it’s horrible guys i know people in life have it worse than i do in illness loss of loved ones etc but i suffer every day because of this and have for the past 5 years i’ve made it this long without having to present by getting out of everything everything my time is running thin i’m going to have to present in the next year or two here now with classes being in person again

i’m a college athlete and my doctor is unsure if i should take propranolol a beta blocker i want to take it as it could reduce my athletic performance but i was only going to take it periodically when i need it so when the drug wears off i don’t see how it would affect me the next day at practice or in a game

if i could move past this issue i would literally feel as if the world is mine it has made me feel subhuman inside for the past 5 years and i am fucking sick of it guys i dread every day leading up to any sort of potential scenario where i may have to speak anywhere i do any and everything in my daily life each day to increase my likelihood of avoiding it i’m sitting here at home over summer literally shaking thinking about when that first day of class comes or when my coach makes us introduce eachother to the entire team even just typing that previous sentence was like a gut punch and a ball drop in my stomach just the meer thought of the pure terror i am going to face again every single day guys i can’t do this anymore it’s getting to be too much i need a solution otherwise i might literally lose my mind this has been the catalyst to so many other issues in my life nobody understands why i “move” the way i do it’s all catered around being able to avoid speaking so i can live to see another day

i had a horrible traumatizing experience as you can imagine while in 11th grade and it’s haunted me ever since the irony of it all is i used to be a great public speaker before this now it is the death of me propranolol is my last hope please can you guys give me success stories with my level of anxiety it feels like there is not a chance this can work life would actually be good again feels impossible it’s nothing but suffering and i’ve just accepted it",1
seeking medication guidance experience i got off of wellbutrin xl after months of constant panic spells lets just say im glad i am here now and not living like that as i came off of it though my depression has gotten worse so on mirtazapine currently and getting it upped i also have a genesight test and mirtaz and wellbutrin r no nos for me pristiq does come up as the best as well as viibryd and fetzima my main apprehension has been i am just so scared to get any negative side effects after what i experienced on wellbutrin i am also a younger guy and have had discreased libido with some meds like prozac etc so very cautious about that as that does not help the mental either i guess i just wonder and hope that the genesite test is accurate and would factor in susceptibility to side effects any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated,1

i’ve just been hit with the reality of the situation i feel physically nauseous and dizzy 

i told the social worker everything that happened w me and him she has had to report it to the child and family agency 

the child and family agency said if i go near him the police will be contacted immediately 

when my he finds out about this he might actually kill me i fucked his and my life up beyond repair 

somebody please help me because i feel like i’m drowning my biggest fear was being a single mum now i’m living with my nmom without even my bank card or hairbrush or anything

 if i went to collect my things from his house the police could be called and social services have told me if i go near him i’m putting my unborn baby in danger and have implied that would make me an unfit mother 

i’m actually living in hell right now 

there is no therapy available i’ve asked for months i’m on the waiting list for a psych appointment a week after my baby is due they don’t help bc they just offer medication 

why the fuck have i done this i regret ever telling the social worker anything now i’m left alone living with my fucked up mother and her new supply in a tiny apartment 

i fucked up his chances of having a child with someone by talking to social services this is so serious and i’m only realising all of this now my child is already fatherless even tho my bf begged to be in her and my life 

what have i done

if he ever has a child again social services will be involved i will never get them out of my life instead of helping me they have worsened things how the fuck can all of this happen and there is no therapy available 

i’ve carried this baby for 8 months and i’m not able to look after her the only option i can see is adoption this is the worst pain i have ever felt in my life i’m too pussy to kill myself so i want to go back to him after i put the baby for adoption and i want to let him kill me he was going to do it eventually anyway 

i can’t imagine a worse pain than having to give away a baby but honestly i never wanted a baby it was always something he wanted and now i’m left with it on my own 

adoption is the only answer because i don’t want me and my baby to be homeless or living with my abusive mother 

where can i run to i can’t believe there is an innocent life tangled up in this 

i’ve learned to never open up again i’ll die with my mouth shut now i miss him and if i go back then social workers will take my baby 

i don’t deserve this baby 

my mother’s not phased by any of it i’m living with someone who puts on a front about how much she cares but in reality all she cares about is appearances i’m lying in bed all day there is nothing to do 

i can’t believe i’m only 22 and i’ve already ruined 3 lives mine my ex’s and my poor baby’s life there is still 3 weeks until i’m full term so i have a chance to turn her life around by adoption but it’s going to kill me honestly after giving my own baby away i think that would give me the courage to just end it 

i carried her for 9 months just for someone else to take her that is a pain worse than death and i can’t imagine life getting any better i keep reaching new lows 

i fucked up his life and i don’t blame him for wanting to killtorture me for it what sort of a person am i i’m ashamed of myself i deserve whatever he does to me and worse 

if i’m not being abused by him i’m being abused by my mother i can’t escape i can’t even leave the country because i only have €100 and no plan 

i have no way out",1

"from stress to strength how i stopped fighting stress  we all know how overwhelming stress can be  
lifes demands can sometimes feel like too much to handle

some scientists believe that the full mindbody response of our emotions evolved as a way to ensure our safety and survival throughout the years  
stress is part of it  
we need to understand the cause and know how to handle it instead of trying to reject it

today i’d like to share a simple yet powerful tool that has helped me manage stress better a journal

what is a feelings journal exactly what it sounds like a place where you can document your emotions daily experiences and thoughts 

how does it help with stress

1 increased selfawareness writing down your feelings and their cause helps you recognize stress triggers and emotional patterns identifying these can be the first step in addressing the sources of your stress
2 emotional release sometimes just getting things off your chest can make a world of difference a feelings journal provides a safe space to vent without judgment
3 problemsolving insights journaling can help you see your problems from a different perspective when you write about what’s stressing you out you might discover new ways to approach these issues
4 reflect and grow periodically reviewing your journal entries can offer insights into how you’ve managed stress in the past highlighting what works and what doesn’t

how to get started

starting a feelings journal is easy and you don’t need any fancy tools here’s a quick guide to get you going

1 choose your medium whether it’s a traditional notebook or a digital app pick what suits you best
2 set aside time dedicate a few minutes each day to jot down your thoughts and feelings consistency is key
3 write freely don’t worry about structure or grammar just let your thoughts flow
4 be kind to yourself remember this is a personal journey

take time to review your past stressful experience  
taking the time to review your past stressful experiences can help you identify patterns this reflective practice will boost your confidence in handling stress the next time you will encounter a similar experience you will recognize it and start reacting differently

stress can be great  
but we need to learn how to handle it",1

"does anyone take antidepressants i really need advice im 19f currently taking 5 mg of lexapro i always have the reason i took it was because i used to not eat a lot back when i was 18 i also tried eating one meal a day back then and on top of that drank coffee to curb my appetite it all started there my heart started to beat fast and felt like it was flying so i ended up being prescribed antidepressants because of that panic feeling

it has helped me out a lot it made me happy and less aggressive towards my parents they notice when im not on antidepressants i become grumpy towards them 

i also noticed back then before i went on my antidepressants i self harm frequently back when i was about 1618

it has helped me with stopping self harm but the thing that it hasnt been helping with recently was that my creativeness went down my panic attacks are worse than ever and i start to shake and my hypochondriac thoughts are coming back

i have talked to my psychiatrist about it and he told me to take 10 mg instead of 5 mg but the last time i tried 10 mg i became even more anxious because it made me feel tired and sleepy it was horrible thats why i did not try to increase my dose

also i had a time where i tried stopping my medication for like 2 weeks and what happened was i couldnt breathe in public i felt nauseous in the car my mood felt down the world felt gray but my libido was high my creativeness and drive went up but my self harming tendencies and my emotions were all over the place i ended up having to take the medication again when i took the medication again i genuinely felt happy this happened in 2023

now its 2024 i get these paranoid and anxious thoughts that i have psychosis probably my hypochondriac because i remember i used to do weed with my old friends in early 2022 but after that i never did it again i also get paranoid of feeling panic whenever i am confronted with a new experienceenvironment

most techniques ive been taught are cognitivebehavioral and revolve around getting back control of your body after panicking which isnt very helpful for me idk the technical term but i usually do things like focus on the physical aspects of anxiety or imagine it as an item in my hands  basically minimize anxiety by making it a thing in my possession rather than a thing i feel inside of and surrounded by id appreciate any advice or resources in this vein",1

ive had some success managing my condition now that im getting up close to my fiftieth birthday 

i still have anxiety but i manage the condition better than ever before and the biggest single lesson ive learned is that there is no magic pill for me there never was a magic pill there probably never will be a magic pill and thats okay

benzos feel fantastic but lead very quickly to addiction alcohol feels like the answer and is fleeting and turns life to crap weed feels euphoric sometimes and it also leads more slowly to addiction and actually seemed to make my baseline anxiety substantially worse

i also found most ssris made my baseline anxiety worse not better

antipsychotics particularly low dose olanzapine helped eventually but made me sleepy sleepy and felt like i fell out of the stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down for the first several weeks of use

theyre sedating no bones about it

general sobriety from recreational drugs even caffeine ended up being the best option with a little ativan just a few times a year as a life preserver when im really losing it

i became so anxious i finally accepted that i was not an expert and i became willing to do what i was told by the actual experts and reported back the whole truth instead of hiding my symptoms or trying to manipulate the situations i had always been told to do dozens of small lifestyle changes and i finally became so desperate i did them all i tried to do everything everyone told me and did everything i found on the internet it was exhausting at first

sleep hygiene hygiene in general breathholding journalling meditation exercise regular intense exercise was really helpful eating well spending time with other people in social situations keeping my home neat clean and organized keeping my focus on tasks and not on ruminating in my own mindetc etc

i talk it out with my psych still i read a mantra and pray every morning i stay hooked into my familyfriendschurch etc support network

i journal like its a lifesaver and i talk back ferociously to the crazy in my head i read self help books regularly i took the six week cbt program offered by the canadian govt

i joined a public speaking club toastmasters which was torture but i needed exposure to social situations to desensitize mei do healthy habits lists and habits the same things at the same times every day

i still have anxiety but its about 80 better it took years but what else was i doing with my time except suffering

now im not hiding from my family im not jumping out of my skin and getting angry every time the phone rings and pretending im not home im not only going out at night to get groceries when the stores are almost closed and empty

now i dont know if i have a health problem or if this is stress but a stressful situation makes it so much worse and when im not in a stressful situation i feel like im always at stressed baseline but it comes intermittently and it doesnt happen all the time its just about eight times throughout the day

symptoms

off balancedizzy

weakness  almost feels like hypoglycemia but its not

overall fatigue

moody

feeling like blood is rushing to my face  like when you are hanging upside down on the monkey bars and blood is rushing to my head

now im not the kind of person to be mean to people every so often i will raise my voice but i usually internalize everything so i pretend like everything is fine even when its not and i believe that this is really doing serious damage on me

if i just sit down and i breathe in and out while listening to a stress video or just relaxing in general and counting my breath 50 or more of this feeling will go away


is this the symptoms of chronic stress im 33 years old and ive been dealing with it for so many years now and i am finally starting to feel symptoms of what i believe is chronic stress

"dont know how to talk to my psychiatrist  tldrive been off my depression meds for almost two months now because im pretty sure it was causing side affects and i dont know how to tell my psychiatrist because i have immense difficulty telling people how im feeling 

bit of background i started out on sertraline and had been on it for several years before realizing it was causing sexual side affects i begrudgingly brought it up to my psychiatrist via email and he moved me to trintellix was on it for a month and realized not only was it again causing sexual side affects im pretty sure it was making my anxiety go off the walls and i was having several panic attacks a week and causing my mood to go out of whack and have violent thoughts and agitation 

when i met with my psychiatrist last time about two and a half months ago i told him the anxiety was terrible and my depression felt like it wasnt being helped at all i hadnt quite noticed the sexual affects yet but honestly probably wouldve been too embarrassed to tell him anyway his response was to simply increase the trintellix instead of increasing i just stopped taking it mostly angry he wasnt listening to me that it wasnt working

the extreme anxiety agitation and violent thoughts have mostly gone away and sexual function has somewhat improved since stopping im not supposed to see him next for a few weeks and i dont know if i should tell him i stopped taking it completely or just tell him what i thought my suspected side affects were and act like ive been taking it so he doesnt have the argument that of course it wasnt working if i didnt take it 

i dont feel comfortable with him in generalbut for no obvious reason hes never done anything wrong but hes the only psychiatrist anywhere nearby id been afraid to email him earlier about possibly having side affects because idk i was afraid hed get upset because at the time i wanted to tell him i wanted to change id just seen him a week or two prior and didnt want him to think im being difficult in wanting to change medications again and also didnt want him to say i just hadnt been on it long enough or something

but seriously im so done im tired of feeling like shit tired of my mood being everywhere all the time tired of stupid medications and side affects i have difficulty telling anyone how im feeling and really would rather just cancel my next appointment instead of talking to him but know if i want to feel better i need to deal with it somehow

i’m 36m and about 20 minutes ago i woke up from a nightmare involving the person  that ruined my life when i was little i was sa’d by a female family member for quite a while i don’t really want to go into detail and remember those moments right now but this nightmare about them has done something new to me 
it started out normal enough of just a nice dream involving my wife who i weirdly referred to as my queen in dream which i don’t say and then i went into a room alone and the tone changed 
it felt like someone’s watching me but i don’t see anything then i suddenly see her through a window and i wake up with tears and an intense fear that i don’t normally get and kept crying and now i’m scared my heads telling me she’s found me and that she’s in my house and i’m too scared to even check my house normally i’m the first one up if there’s a strange noise in the house and i refuse to wake my wife and let her see me like this 

i hope my head stops screaming at me soon and that my eyes dry sorry if this triggers anyone else ",1
"for some reason ive remembered u can breathe manually and now every time i think about it i cant stop breathing manually so im a very anxious personl  and last night i saw a stupid tiktok that reminds you that u can breathing manually and i had this thought that if i remember this i will never breathe subconsciously and throughout the day ive sometimes been distracted but as soon as im not i remember this thought and become very anxious and start controlling my breathing as i can no longer do it subconsciously 

i feel really stupid and im so stressed right now i feel like this has really ruined my day and i really dont want to remember ber this but for some reason its really hard to forget i feel very stressed and alone 

please help me if you have had similar  experiences because im getting tested for anxiety this weekend and ocd not because of this and i would really like someones feedback ❤️

"stress causing hallucination in elderly hi everyone 

i’m confused because i have a family member that is experiencing hallucinations and agitation out of no where 

i raised concerns about that plus other things such as hair loss to the doctor the doctor keeps reporting memory loss concerns but memory loss is not an issue in my opinion the family member’s memory is good and better than some younger kids…shoot even mine

it’s the hallucination that’s the concern

the refuse to consider the meds being the causes of that but agreed that the med management is a little messy currently 

i contacted the pharmacist where we picked the meds up at and they review her prescription history on a quick phone call and think it can be a result of low sugar maybe but says the meds in question wouldn’t cause that

it confuses me because i looked up the meds in question and they have side effects of what i’m complaining about online

i’m trying to figure out what to do my hope was to get the medical team on the same page so we can stop the meds monitor test and analyze from their that way we can manage the meds a little better and slowly add things back as needed and safely

i don’t understand why everyone is saying there’s no side effects or not these side effects as the side effects in question pops up on the first page of google

what can i do the medical team didn’t see anything that stands out on the mri but is calling the issue maybe dementia due to a memory loss test that i believe the family member did good in i was there it was just calculations that were not good 

i’m going to connect with a neurologist next but i just don’t want to be quick to call something dementia when it’s might be due to medication

it’s like they just want to give meds that have similar effects to these other diagnoses or disorders and say that person has x and when it gets worse it’s not due to x but truly secretly due to the meds

i’m just hoping to connect and learn from others here in hopes with making the next best steps to help with what’s happening

meds in question
mirtazapine
atorvastatin
diabetic medication one was recently stopped which i thought was the cause of the hallucinations but they started the family memeber on mirtazapine the same week where things got worst

they assigned more meds in the past but i believe the issue started from one or both of these",1
"has anyone else here ever had anxiety that wouldnt go away no matter what you did i often wake up with really bad anxiety or it starts to creep up on me as the day progresses most of it is freefloating but sometimes it is situational or anticipitory

"vent panic attackshoulder injurygreening out mental health twadvice hi sorry in advance this may be long but i really just need to get this off my chest even if no one reads it

i f22 had a terrible expirience last night and need advice and to share with someone i reguarly get high using edibles and i took some last night come to find out i took 20mg which is double my usual dose anyways the high was going as normal until i was laying in bed for context i have a lot of joint and just body pain issues and my right shoulder had been hurting while i was laying in bed it sounds kind of bad but this shoulder has been off for like at least a year just randomly popping clicking but not a ton of pain or anything i also get massages for neck and shoulder tension and have had chronic knots so i thought that was causing most of the issues but last month my massage therapist asked about my shoulder injury and what i did to it and i said i never had a shoulder injury it sounds dumb but i brushed her off at the time but looking back i shouldve realized this like my shoulder always hurt during massages especially when they put my arm behind my back etc 

now fast forward to last night i was laying in bed and couldnt get my arm comfortable no matter what i did i assumed i was freaking myself out so i was stretching it and trying to just rest it so i could get comfortable after like 30 minutes of doing this i realized something may be actually wrong with my shoulder i live with my sister so i left my room to talk to her and this is when i really started pancking i told her i was high but i felt like something was wrong with my shoulder but couldnt really pinpoint what was wrong i felt like i wasnt explaining myself well and started to get more anxious like 5 minutes later i have her look at my shoulder to see if she can see anything but she cant i can still tell something is wrong because my shoulder and arm feels numb i start crying and having a panic attack but i have no idea for how long ive had panic attacks before but this was one of the worst i also know what greening out and panic attacks from that feel like anyways i couldnt stop shaking and was trying to figure out what to do i start to hyperventilate but eventually drink water and try to rationalize this doesnt work great but we come to the conclusion i should just go to the doctor in the morning and that i should try to sleep i agree at try to sleep at 9pm i toss and turn for like 30 min before texting her because at this point i can tell something is actually wrong with my shoulder i start to panic and spiral again and feel my entire chest and right arm and shoulder turn numb but then burning tight ive pretty much convinced myself im doing permenant damage to my shoulder which i may have but idk yet or im having a stroke 

after a bit of texting back and forth and saying to just go to the doctor in the morning i fall asleep again this is where it gets really weird while i slept i had a migraine the whole time which i know is from the panic attack hyperventilating but i also had horrible nausea which i had been expiriencing for a few days before this anyways i dont even remember walking down the hall to my bathroom but i suddenly wake up in my bathroom next to the toilet just sitting there trying not to throw up i was completley out of it and had no idea when i had gotten there i kept trying to stand up to leave and laydown in bed but whenever i did i felt like i was going to throw up again i finally manage to stand up and felt like i was going to pass out which i have before when i greened out a different time while im walking to my bed i suddenly wonder if im even real is this really happening how did i get to the bathroom how long had i been in there which wasnt a great feeling i look at the clock and its 1am and i text my sister again saying i almost passed out but she didnt respond obviously because she was alseep i wake up at 9am with myself laying completley flat in bed with no pillows because of my shoulder i feel a bit normal make breakfast etc then realize my shoulder still hurts 

  
i dont really understand whats going on or how i managed to hurt myself but im spiraling honestly my anxiety and depression has been horrible the past few days and i cant stop crying im in pain and i feel like ive kinda hit my breaking point i honestly wanted to die last night i just feel like life keeps testing me and im so tired

"tips to feel better when you’re having anxiety at an event hi everyone 

i have struggled with anxiety for at least 10 years my biggest trigger is when i’m invited to an event that’s further away and i’m not driving i start to feel trapped my anxiety manifests both physically and mentally i’m usually struggling days before the event and then when i get there i will start feeling really hot my stomach hurts i get acidy and nauseous i can’t eat much before usually but then i’m starving but sick starving where i don’t wanna eat  i feel sick and dizzy and start to dissociate i ust become a mess basically and then start having thoughts like i need to leave but i’m trapped etc i wouldn’t even consider it social anxiety i’m diagnosed gad bc i’m generally fine speaking to people i just get overwhelmed easily and hate the idea of feeling like i have to be somewhere for a set period of time and can’t leave i feel like a freak i’ve done therapy for years and i’ve been on zoloft i also exercise regularly 

it’s gotten to the point where my depression really kicks in and i just don’t even wanna go or look forward to things bc it never seems to get better it doesn’t just go away i’m usually stuck in my head and not feeling well so after the event it’s not like i’m like “wow look that was actually so fun” usually i’m thanking the stars i’m done 

anyway i’m seeing someone newer i like so much and he invited me to this mma event his work is sponsoring it’s an event that’s about 45 minutes away and we will ride together i agreed because well i like him and didn’t wanna turn him down but since then i’ve been spiraling i also found out the event is like 8 hours which is even more scary to me worst part is i was supposed to start wellbutrin a couple weeks ago and planned to make this week the week i finally get the courage to take it but now this is coming up on saturday and i feel too afraid to try something new

does anyone have any tips on how they get through anxiety at events and actually enjoy it

"finding it difficult to care anymore ive posted before about how our youngest daughter ended all communication with us after she and her husband moved to minnesota we are completely in the dark over why son in law wouldnt tell us and now he has stopped communicating also our oldest daughter still hears from her sister and tells us she is doing fine but provides no details

so we find out that our daughter and her husband were in texas at his parents house this weekend to celebrate his sister getting engaged his parents live less than two hours from us less than two hours we could have easily driven up to visit

there is something in my past that often makes me feel i should have moved far away afterward and never gotten involved in a relationship ever again because of me not because of my wife our childrens behavior reinforces that feeling thanks for letting me vent",1
"my anxious household is a nightmare right nowi’m trying to hold it together  the last three years have been so destructive thanks to my anxiety i have tried four different medications a mood enhancer and tried two different therapists found the right one in 2022 about eight months ago my husband was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and it is causing lots of disagreements 

first he was convinced that he didn’t have anxiety then he gave medication a try and it made a huge difference he also started seeing a therapist and for or a period of three months both of us showed some improvement unfortunately he is back to believing he doesn’t have anything wrong and has stopped taking meds he quit therapy secretly as well his anxiety is back to where it was before diagnosis and now it’s making mine worse he gets so angry if anyone says he seems different i’m walking on broken glass with hope that no one hears it crunching under my feet

"what anxiety medication have you taken and what has been your experience about a month ago my f25 fiance m26 experienced an anxiety attack while out of town on a trip and now seems to have some generalized anxiety that wont go away hell now feel overwhelmed and feels anxiety attacks creeping in every now and now since the trip he has always had a bit of anxiety but this has reached a completely different level for him and its really concerning him 

he went to his doctor and got blood work done and some testing and everything looks normal he did get a referral for a psychiatric evaluation after he shared what happened and how he is feeling

he has made an appointment with a psychiatrist for later this month and he knows he needs medication he keeps telling me that he just wants to feel normal again and wants to get back to his life hes nervous about taking medicine for it but he knows he needs it and doesnt want to continue like this

i am trying to be as supportive as i can and just be there even if he just needs someone there to feel less lonely if he has an anxiety attack i want to learn more about medications for anxiety and how people feel with it and how it is without it potential side effects etc i want to be able to help if he ever needs it and just be better informed

first could you explain how an anxiety attack feels ive never experienced one and dont have much anxiety to begin with so i really want to understand how he feels and maybe what is going through his head

and for anxiety medications there seems to be a lot of different ones and i wanted to see what people were taking their experience and their side effects for example medications like lexapro prozac buspar fluoxetine celexa zoloft etc 

what has been your experience",1

"my anxiety ruined a big vacation so basically me and my mom decided to travel overseas for vacation to turkey we went for a few days last year and wanted to stay 10 days this time the first time we went mom sis and i i had a mini panic attack after we arrivedi think just culture shock and seeing how busy and congested everything is but then i was fine and we had a good time 
this year i said let’s stay longer and was sooo excited we planned out soo many fun things and booked 2 nice hotels everything was so exciting and then as soon as we finished resting at the hotel when we arrived the panic began to set in i told my mom i would be fine it’s just the first day anxiety but i got so much worse every time we went out even just walking slowly i got such bad anxiety i kept needing to cry and want to go back to the hotel it kept getting worse and worse and i couldn’t function my mom is so supportive and kept asking what i needed and if i wanted to leave literally the next day but of course i said no i wanted her to enjoy too after pushing myself and trying to go out when i was calmer i just got worse i asked her if we could pay to move up the tickets a few days bc i thought that would calm me we moved it so we only had like 3 days left paid 800 then that same day we went out and i just wanted to cry and had to keep myself from freaking out my anxiety was so bad i couldn’t even lay down without constantly moving i couldn’t even handle the thought of any more days even though my mom said we could just stay in the hotel i asked if we could move the tickets up again and she said of course we paid another 400 to leave the same night 

i just landed back in the states and feel like crap i ruined what was supposed to be a great vacation for my mom and me we spent about 6000 all for me to ruin it we are by no means rich a lot of that went onto credit cards but we said who cares we need a break from all the stress in our lives
my mom and dad are literally the most loving and supportive and keep telling me it’s fine don’t be sorry we just want you to be ok but of course i’m so depressed that my anxiety did in fact ruin what could’ve been a great trip i’m in the car heading back home and i don’t want to face anyone i’m so embarrassed on one hand i know anxiety cannot be controlled a lot of times but it’s hard when ur the only person in the family who has it that bad ocd and i try so hard to be tougher but then something like this happens and i feel so dumb i ruined a trip i pushed for and arranged everything for and was soooo excited for i really hate myself 

i thought my anxiety was under control it’s been over a year since i was that bad and i thought i had come so far and would be ok only to shatter that confidence knowing it can happen again and i wouldn’t be able to function without help

3 months ago i went fine again but 2 weeks ago i was just sitting down and started feeling like an ice cold sensation driving up my right side of my body my whole body went numb i dont know how to explain it but i could feel my insides i called my dad and he came and picked me up i was fine after it so i knew it was a panic attack

"how to not be paranoid and not have probably irrational fears i dont really know if this is the right subreddit so sorry if it isnt

i have social anxiety since ever but i could always deal with it without it making my life horrible since a few months it has been a bit different and i started being paranoid as well last year i started to go to concert on my own im female and 22 because i dont have that many friends due to my anxiety and they dont like the same artists i didnt want to miss out anymore and i really need to say it was great i enjoyed the concerts even talked to people and had almost no anxiety i did about 10 concerts in 6 months which is a lot for me and wanted to continue it

this year i already had two but for both i was so paranoid thinking that i will get kidnapped on my way to the hotel or that someone breaks into the hotel room while im sleeping or that i get stabbed with a knife while taking the train to get there or literally any bad thought you could think of and i already book hotels close to the venue so i only need to cross two roads while they are still a lot of people leaving the venue but even then the few weeks before a concert i worry so much that i cant really be excited and are overthinking everything i even thought of just cancelling it because the fear is sometimes taking over and its not even because of the concert itself because thats fine but about the way to the venue and back to the hotel

i have 6 more concerts planned this year within the next two months while im free from university and work and i already worry so much i dont really know what to do and why this is suddenly the way it is i also didnt have any bad experiences last year that triggered this

"crazy side effects over the past 8 years i’ve searched for a medication that works well to combat my anxiety and depression symptoms about 2 years ago my doctor and i finally settled on viibryd due to it having little to no side effects on my body  mental health compared to the many other medications i’ve tried 

i finally feel like something is working for me and my way of life has improved exponentially 

except…well…one thing… my reflexes

i get spooked and i mean spooked when everyday events happen here’s a few examples 
1 if someone comes around the corner and i don’t hear them i jump about 10 feet in the air 
2 if someone opens the bathroom door to come in while i am opening the door on the other side to go out i jump and gasp so loud it scares the other person
3 if i see a small car accident i panic and my heart races as if i’m involved in the accident i feel like i might pass out 
4 i see a roach i’m screaming 
5 i see a shadow i jump in a panic

my heart is always racing over these seemingly small events 

i have never been easily spooked i’m in my mid20s i’m relatively healthy i’ve never been in an accident knock on wood and i’ve never been attacked by anything so idk why i’m so jumpy… 

is it just me is anybody out there 

edit one of the side effects of viibryd is serotonin syndrome after some research i found that many of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome are related to reflexes one of these symptoms includes hyperreflexia which is an overactive or overresponsive bodily reflexes usually that has more to do with twitching but i feel like my overreactions fall somewhat under this category  ",1

i know i’m a nice person and a generous person but i’ve made mistakes and trying to forgive myself for those seems impossible",1

what made you decide to start taking medication to those of you who take medication for anxiety issues what made you decide to start taking it in the first place how much has it helped you improve my therapist who im seeing mainly due to sleep problems suggested that next week when i have my first appointment with a psychiatrist for my sleep problems i should mention my anxiety issues too to see how we can improve on that and now im questioning myself if id agree to take medication for my anxiety with all the cons and pros of it,1

"instant help a directly applicable and triedandtested stepbystep guide against inner restlessness and stress hey guys 

do you know a book which describes the following or are you interested if i find one

war pandemic inflation the decade burdens many people with a lot of additional baggage there are selfhelp books available on the market for people who feel constant inner restlessness and are constantly stressed most of these books are scientific and very complicated

  
to those who are worried

if it existed what would you think of a proper practical stepbystep guide that offers real life tested and therefore working psychological strategies to return to inner peace and a calm mind

  
in times of information overload the guide should be short clear and full of valuable content this can include advice on general techniques for reducing stress and going deeper by addressing specific situational triggers 

for the trigger it provides a technique for dealing with the trigger and a practical example of how it works including an explanation of why it works  


for example  
constant trigger general restlessness – i feel worried and therefore nervous the feeling is there constantly and i dont like it but dont know what to do about it

  
technique claritycreating introspection flow  
step 1 clear your head  quick clearing is 34 rounds of wim hof breathing would be explained in the book but for those who dont know now  i recommend googling it  
step 2 take a piece of paper and a pen  
step 3 let your thoughts guide you write everything down if a thought interrupts you allow it use a “” put a number above it and just let it flow the most disturbing thoughts will return so you can simply take the number from when the thought first appeared then write the number on the new hyphen and thus tie in with the first section of thought  
step 4 reread your flow can be painful but very liberating search for a topic or topic  
step 5 write down the topic  
step 6 what could solve the issue  
step 7 take one small step now to solve the problem

  
example i feel very stressed i clear my head with my breathing exercise step 1 i take my piece of paper and let my thoughts flow steps 23 i see that i keep having the critical thought that complains about the lack of progress on my project i call my topic “project too slow” steps 45 i brainstorm and come to the conclusion i need to break my project down into many many more subgoals step 6 this way i can get more done and procrastinate less  
my action step now is i take the “breakdown of the project plan” approach and spend just one mandatory minute opening my project plan and formulating another doable task  
then im done or i can keep working on it it doesnt matter im clear about whats bothering me subconsciously and i know what i can do about it and ive already taken one step towards it

  
functionality bringing subconscious thoughts to light and putting them on paper resolving them and acting on them will solve the underlying problem step 6 and step 7 can be repeated until the entire cause is resolved  
i would really appreciate an ebook guide like this what about you guys do you know a book like that is this a type of help you would like to use if not what kind of support would you prefer

"i dont have regrets i have anxiety ranting
these are my circumstances
no antidepressants no money anxiety issues flaring as i make realizations and need somewhere to talk about it while i have too much anxiety and other neurodivergent issues to call a therapist

here are my thoughts
i dont have regrets i have anxiety my mind constantly thinks and races over every worse case scenario and i cant exist without medications anxiety makes it where you regret everything pick apart piece by piece why or how you couldve done something different and if you had done something different you wouldnt be experiencing the anxiety you are right now it doesnt take into consideration anything else in the situation just that if youd done something different you wouldnt have anxiety or be stressed out about it 

oh and the things that i couldve done differently i did those things to help with my anxiety and daily functioning to overall allow me to be happier d so clearly theres always a downside to decisions made to help yourself and i made those decisions when i was financially stable and had money and did even afterwards for a little bit as soon as i run out of antidepressants and its been a few days fun thoughts fun times and ultimate utilization of previously learned coping skills because honestly its the only time that i can effectively will myself to use them because otherwise what i am experiencing is so intense either on a depressive or anxiety side that it is not something i can will myself to do there are times i can will myself to do the things i was taught for my depression and anxiety and other times it doesnt matter what i want or much try to do my mind will focus all of its energy into it until i am exhausted and then maybe maybe i wont be as emotionally sensitive sometimes im not sometimes i am 

should i even talk about how my partner is autistic experiences depression anxiety and other things and sometimes it feels like she doesnt understand that it isnt something i can do trying to use coping skills because its so exhaustive and im so hyper focused on my feelings  but i know they obviously understand the inability to do something no matter how much they want to it just hurts and its all hard and i just need someone who understands how overwhelming it is not being on bc and antidepressants and when youre about to start your period no more birth control because pulmonary emboli d 

no money  no blood thinner  no birth control  pulmonary emboli  constantcurrent stress and worry about related symptoms that could be anxiety acid reflux or because of the clot and struggle to physically get oxygen into my body  more anxiety 
no money  more anxiety no money  no doctors  no bc alternatives  pcos cysts heavy bleeding worse mood swings  more anxiety more issues untreated problems 

and to take into account the fact ive been on bc much of my menstruating life started taking it after a few years because of heavy painful cramps and later got diagnosed pcos i dont know what my body and hormones are like off of birth control or if it would be that much different its been a month and a half since ive stopped taking it and i dont know when my hormones would stabilize except now they really wont now that i have been out of antidepressants for probably five days now time blindness been thinking its one day later all week

anyway thanks for listening not looking for anything at most if someone can relate to or understand any my experiences so i dont feel so alone and crazy with the overthinking and everything else its why i still want to go to therapy and understand the how and why of me  because my current diagnoses and lack thereof dont make me feel that all my issues are properly being seen and heard but im almost entirely convinced it is severe generalized anxiety at the very least it would feel better to know that if this is other peoples experiences with anxiety because if it isnt then it would give me further reason to feel like there is something else that isnt being explained other than simply feeling that way because thats anxiety isnt it

tldr 
not having money makes my anxiety worse which makes everything else a bigger problem than it is ranting ",1
"lost and anxiety heavily triggered right now hi currently my anxiety is heavily triggered and i need help

i have such a hard time getting it under control i spiral i am irrational i loop over the same things i became aggressive when i speak i am restless i cry i feel like all i have is tunnel vision and i cannot stay still

and i know full well that when i’m going to calm down i’m going to look at all i have thought said done under my anxiety and i’m going to think “damn that’s cringe how could i ever be like that and i inflict that to my loved one” so i can’t keep requestion my loved one and they always make me understand how annoying i get because the state i get in is so exaggerated and it’s over so silly little things…

medically i am lost

last time i saw my therapist was months ago i was doing well told her i managed my then last anxiety attack by requesting one specific friend’s help and multiple times during the appointment she said things like “is that appointment useful to you do you think you needed that” told her that may be no because i was well that day because luckily that time i managed my anxiety attack i call it an anxiety attack but that’s probably not the right term she implied that since i managed used my “support system” i didn’t really need her

when planning next appointment she asked “do you think you really need one we could just text or call back when you need one just mind that there might be a 3 week waiting period” which i told her that yes i still need one especially for crisis but also my anxiety is still there i am not healed i just managed the symptoms more or less she kept set on the “call me back if needed” then she told me ‘bon vent’ and ‘i wish you the best’ which i guess translate to “farewell”

felt unseen misunderstood a fraud like am i really anxious and depressed if my own therapist tells me that am i faking it never called her back

we agreed that i might have adhd that i have cyclothymia and then what no thing like always like it’s the 4th therapist i’ve seen in adulthood  2 therapists in my teenage years  one psychiatry doctor

my gp doesn’t help either got almost aggressive when i asked for xanax last time and told her i was still on trazodone “you know the risk right” what does that mean girl i you prescribed me those med 6 years ago when my mother died and kept doing until then why is it a problem now besides i barely take any xanax only during crisis or too intense restlessness i last months with one box never mix it always wait at least 24h between takes never more than 3 time during the same weeks and i can go weeks or months without taking any it purely depends on if i have crisis or not

i quit drinking before it got out of hands 7 months ago i am hecking proud of that i told my doctors

i have been on antidepressant which by the way really sucked felt numb couldn’t regulate body temp no libido when i told my doctors that i felt it didn’t help they told me “it’s because it works” been off of it for a year and all i can say is i cry again and now i have libido

i am always tired i have chronic pain and migraine my labs are normal so all is well

i feel i will never heal no solution is permanent

and i know i should change doctors therapist again it’s so exhausting and costly

when my anxiety is triggered just like it is now i just think and loop over all of that all the time i got so panicked and irrational how i don’t have solution and i’ll post this and in a few hours when i’ll calm down i’ll just think “damn you are cringe what a bloody idiot are you sure you are an adult you are so stupid see all is well now it’s all in your head you must be faking it”

i’ll try to rot in bed today

"anxious about not feeling anxiety for the year before i moved out of my parents house things got really bad for my mental health parents were constantly triggering ptsdocd fighting constantly and on top of this i had just gotten out of a toxic 3 year long relationship and had a falling out with a lot of my friends 

this led to days of showering at the gym staying at my community college till doors closed etc just to stay away from home as much as i could eventually even being away from home would cause panic knowing i had to go back and the second i stepped through the doors it’d be instant anxiety i’d go to bed nightly shaking with fear and be completely sleepless eventually it was time to move to college and i was so excited that all of my issues where going to be fixed or so i thought

when i moved away i had a few days where i felt great and then it started i think my brain started feeling like something was wrong since i wasn’t panicked anymore and it’s almost like it created more anxiety to deal with it i developed new ocd focuses and day to day my anxiety would get worse again 

now that i’m trying actively to recover from this whenever i take a second to think “wow i’m having a good day and my anxiety isn’t bothering me” it rears up immediately 

does anyone else experience this",1

"work related anxiety i guess  work related anxiety i guess

hi i started in the work force about 25 years ago i got a job at a different state from my family so i rented a house there and worked there the first  month was ok quite boring nothing to do then the next month i got terrible anxiety not sure why out of the blue i told my parent and everything i thought i could tough it out but i broke then i left the job and came back home and got a temporary contract job which i worked for 2 month trying to get my shit  together before getting my current permanent job during this time i was going to my cousin for therapy he asked me to do affirmations and did behavioural therapy and just gave me advice and some hypnosis stuff too he is still abit inexperienced about 200hrs of practice but it helps slightly 

i started working in my company about 2 years ago for the first 6 months i was doing ok this was in december 2022 eventually my boss told me i was getting promoted in a years time slowly i developed fears and get scared for every part of my job i can do the job its not that hard but the workload gets heavy very fast and often colleagues are decent bosses are supportive salary quite good but my job is slightly abit too nicheit may be beneficial in a long run but im not sure i get anxious on and off when dealing with customers and leading factory acceptance tests 

i have been in the same type of therapy with him for a while but im starting to doubt talking will solve my issues at one point it got worse i went to a psychiatrist he prescribed me valdoxan 25mg it kinda helped me buy muffling the fear like covering a scream with a pillow and anxiety but made me blank and moody the anxiety started to crawl back up after a while so i stopped after 3 weeks knowing i dont need to taper down or anything i felt ok for a while but the anxiety is lesser but always there right before work every day making me want to quit every time i dont know why 

fast forward to recently our company was on a break for 6 days a long awaited break 3 days in i was fine then i started to have a terrible gut wrenching feeling right below my sturnum going down words i recognise this feeling i had this when i was at 12 15 17 years old right before major exams i think it was the fear of failure since the middle of the holiday it is still here till today i tell my self and my mind i am fine i have nothing to worry if i get firedwhich is probably unlikely fk it ill get a new job i dont know what to do i cant keep this up its torture

"what should you sacrifice for your mental health dealing with anxiety can feel like a constant juggling act especially when it comes to balancing everything life throws at you while taking care of yourself here are some thoughts that might help

1 take time for you it’s super important to make space for things that recharge you like hanging out with friends who get you or doing stuff you love sometimes that means saying no to extra work hours or skipping out on plans that stress you out
2 set boundaries learning to say no without feeling guilty is a gamechanger it’s okay to put yourself first and protect your mental health maybe that means skipping a party or saying no to that extra shift at work
3 get support therapy and meds can really help don’t hesitate to talk to your therapist or doctor about what’s working and what’s not they’re there to help you find a balance that works for your life
4 be kind to yourself remember it’s okay to stumble sometimes dealing with anxiety is tough and it’s totally normal to have ups and downs be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way
5 figure out your priorities take a step back and think about what really matters to you sometimes letting go of stuff that society says you should do can take a load off your shoulders

"life update on healing awhile back i posted about having some serve anxiety and dpdr with my meditation long story short my psychiatrist was bumping me up way too fast and i had activation it was horrible the most suicidal i’ve ever been i felt crazy and helpless the dread and fear was constant and the intrusive thoughts were just horrible telling me i’m not going to get better and everyone is lying to me that i am or am i real a lot of mind body disconnection i still somewhat feel the disassociation but at least there’s not intense anxiety attached to it i went to a mental health urgent care the staff and psychiatrist saved my life the psychiatrist helped me through what i was going through and explained and answered questions about the medication and what it was doing to my brain and body she suggested lowering the dose and adding in anti anxiety med she also suggested in getting a new therapist because the one i had wasn’t working it’s been 2 weeks since then and i’ve noticed a difference in anxiety not very anxious and my intrusive thoughts have calm down a lot my new therapist is actually giving me tools to help me deal with my anxiety and depression as well i still have dpdr but slowly it’s going away but here’s the thing in the back of my head i don’t want the anxiety to go away because i’m worried about “what if i have an attack and i don’t know how to flow with it” it’s the only thing keeping me from completely letting go of the worry at this moment i just think it’s wild that our brain and do some much harm when it’s thinks it’s keeping us safe 

anyone who’s having a hard time with overly sensitive hearing or rapid fire thoughts i’ve been doing guided meditation or sound baths while going to bed it does help for me and reading books on ways to help cope with everything helps as well sometimes what you read doesn’t necessarily connect to you but it’s always good to read those parts anyways incase you end up needing the tools or reassurance later if something happens i was reading that what helps with certain things is community as well interacting not just reading so engaging with each other can help the psyche and for anyone having hard time with anxiety and intrusive thoughts i just remind myself that we can reprogram our brain with cbt and that usually helps the process and for anyone who thinks the are going crazy or going to go into psychosis or schizophrenia just remember that your anxiety is trying to latch on to anything to help  make sense of what is happening it’s trying to find a threat i do still have moments where i feel like i’m hearing or “seeing” things but it’s just my anxiety trying to find a threat of any kind stay strong and just know it’s okay to get help and not bottle everything help

when i was in college my psychology professor required a group presentation and it was me and 3 others when the time came near to present it i just couldnt do it i had sooooooo much anxiety and finished my part so early and i privately texted one of the people in my group my part of the project and told her i wasnt feeling good to present i ended up dropping out of the class because i was way too anxious to present i was thinking about it for weeks and couldnt sleep because of it when it was drawing near it only got worse i would think about it constantly and would prevent me from doing anything because i would think ugh i have to present this the class was filled with 30 people and i couldnt do it this is the extreme part i ended up dropping out college entirely because of that one powerpoint presentation i was so anxious and embarrassed and felt like if i couldnt do that then why would i think id finish the rest of college because i didnt finish my semester i also willingly took the risk of being charged 1k because of the textbooks and the courses not being finished this is proof of how anxiety indeed affects everyday life even things that seem simple its so hard anxiety costed me 8 years of my education and 1k all because i couldnt present a single powerpoint

i live in los angeles and these past couple of days while i was showering i always get postnasal drip for no reason now i am susceptible to getting sinusitis here and there very often and i think i have one now too cause my temples hurt and i have green things coming out of my nose when i blow really hard it does not always come out but they sometimes do

now i have no idea that water went up my nose or not because i have felt it did while showering but i never coughed nor reacted to it but felt very bad postnasal drip

"life long insecurity self hate imposter syndrome basically like a self existence dysmorphia has been ruining my entire life i wish i knew how others perceived me i dont even know where to start  
  
i keep trying to write this but it just seems like im stroking my ego i know there are so many people that actually have shitty circumstances but its like my brain is stuck in this weird spot where i cant accept what i have   
  
im doing great at work it seems like most coworkers and my boss love me i can fuck around as much as i want within reason and the boss never really gets mad at me as long as i clean up which i do i play hard i work hard if any issues do come up he usually takes my side with little consideration   
  
i have friends that i know genuinely care about me with things theyve done or said throughout the years  
  
i dont understand why its so hard to accept this   
  
for some reason i always felt like the last pick for everything and like i was useless  
  
my parents hated that i was a very energetic loud and expressive child so maybe now i force myself to hide that  
  
im super shy and quiet and i hate that about myself the few people i trust know how loud and rowdy i get but everyone sees this hidden reserved side of me which i attribute to my parents always calling me an embarrassment basically  
  
they never praised me for my good work if i ever did anything good the usual answers i got  are why didnt do more or you want to be noticedrewarded for something youre already supposed to be doing  
  
i also know that i used to be a huge fucking bully back in elementary school idk why but i loved pissing people off i guess pretty much all of my current friends told me that when they first met me id bully and pick at them  
  
i think this gave me very little friends and the perception that i was just unlikeable obviously that shit fucked me up throughout higher grades and i was super quiet and shy thinking people hated me for no reason  
  
now im nice and care for people work hard and people seem to like me and all i can think of is how theyre all faking it to be nice for some reason  
  
maybe its cuz i bullied people maybe its cuz my parents were kinda jerks but i grew up thinking i was worthless and unlikeable   
  
but now im working hard on my socializing with people and general work ethic and people like me people invite me to hangouts people initiate conversation with me they dont seem grossed out or anything by my presence and its just really hard to accept   
  
i keep thinking like i just need one more person to say something nice about me but ive had that so many times already i worked really hard to get where i am but i cant accept it   
  
i kinda wish there was a way to know how people view me   
  
i see attractive people smart people funny people and everyone gets their own little like general personality tab  
  
the smart friends that always have answers for everything the funny friends that seem to be  entertaining with zero effort the insanely charismatic and adventurous ones that take charge and have an adventure every meet up   
  
what the fuck am i  
  
in my head im some like awkward little dude that kinda hides and people are slightly uncomfortable to be around  
  
i wish i just had a way to know how others saw me  
  
i can infer from what people tell me but i can never be too sure and that uncertainty usually turns to doubt and then self hatred again  
  
like are there people that respect me are there people that notice how funny i am or at least try to bethink i am are there people who think im just stupid or maybe goofy on purpose are there people that respect me for the work i do or do they know im more or less guessingfaking it and making it look good  
  
its just that i have so many like opinions about people what theyre good at what theyre bad at how they loo all this and that  
  
it kills me not knowing how others see me and what they think of me  
  
i guess i could ask but thats kinda pathetic and usually warrants some fake ass bullshit yeah man youre great we love you haha ",1

"is this anxiety  ever since child i’ve felt this intense pain in my chest  stomach this impending doom kind of feeling i was bullied at school because of being a big kid home was harsh wealthy but absent parents i always worry for the tiniest things i always make up the worst scenarios 
lately the pain has been affecting me mentally in such a way that i am not able to function 
sometimes i get paranoid about just feeling like this and it turns out to be this never ending spiral i started consuming alcohol at age of 13 because it helped me get rid of this feeling 3 beers in and not a care in the world parents were never home until late evening if they were there it was a mother yelling and a father who rarely ever spoke to me my drinking got pathological i’ve quit at age 23 picked up cannabis… 4 years later i’ve quit that too 
only now i see i never used these substances to get high  feel pleasure  just to release this tension in me i am sick and i know it… just wondering if that’s what’s called anxiety 
it sometimes drives me in such places such mental states that it got me considering opting out but i want to think i’m a fighter and i won’t give in also intrusive thoughts they torment me before sleep every night it also gets me aggressive i believe it’s other people who put me in this state my feeling of misanthropy got so bad lately i wish for nuclear war i just want this shit to end worst thing is whenever i see a light in the tunnel this blanket of cold takes it all always from me ",1

"anxiety and ugliness always on edge i think it’s common knowledge that the less attractive you are the harder “social stuff” will be not just romantically but in regard to friendships even basic cordiality between fellow people as well basically if you’re ugly enough you have to make up for it with your personality your intellect or some kind of special talent and of course most do there are tons of ugly actors businessmen athletes i mean take a look at any rock band from the 60s70s they’re some ugly dudes if i was like this i’d be fine i’d find my group and stick to them or i’d live a reclusive peaceful life doing my own thing and answering to nobody possibly as a monk of some sort

yet there is a certain kind of ugliness that is below this the kind where you’re openly mocked ridiculed and gossiped about by people you may not even know where you have to basically live life on guard because you don’t know who’ll say something awful to you where your appearance is quite literally the only thing people will see and will ever care to see the level of ugliness people like cyraxx or other “lolcows” suffer from i unfortunately suffer from this level of ugliness 

my entire life i was the target for bullying no not a target the target it started overt nothing physical though then as i became more reclusive quiet people would come up to me to “poke me” ie try to get me to make myself look stupid or say something rude to me i couldn’t even be left alone in a school of nearly 3000 people i was a joke to probably 90 of them the other 10 probably felt so bad for me that they would halfpity me my treatment is probably comparable to quasimodo to most of them my torment anguish is entertainment and the ultimate satisfaction would be to see me slowly die i got in a small accident on the way to school one day last year my peers were unhappy i didn’t die guaranteed if i did they’d be pissed it wasn’t “slow and painful” enough of course i wasn’t seen as “human” either i’ve had people refer to me as an “it” one of my classmates implied i was going to hell he had maybe seen me once or twice before another point i may have mentioned was the fact that people see me as “special” yes people have said i “looked” like someone with an intellectual disability they weren’t talking about my behavior they’d just met me this didn’t end after i lost weight changed my style either they probably enjoyed talking about how much “that creature” is trying to “live like us” 

random people in public stare at me usually different depending on the age younger people give me blank “wtf” glares older individuals women especially give that “pity smile” you give to someone with a disability people i meet are generally rude and standoffish as well or again pitiful 

of course i’m always on guard these days to see who’s mocking me glaring at me when i’m around people i try not to contribute too much but some comment always comes up about my appearance one way or another it’s virtually a paranoia at this point where i don’t have the energy the drive to go out and live anymore for fear of being mocked and harassed for…existing

i hate the fact that i’ll never be normal i don’t know what to do i don’t want to live a painful life of mockery yet i also don’t want to die ",1

flash forward to a month ago i began having pain in that area again my doctor told me it was most likely a muscle strain and to give it some time i gave it 2 weeks stressed as hell because i knew the pain i felt meant the tumor was back and finally got a script for an mri during the week waiting for my mri i began peeing a lot i usually pee when i’m nervous but this particular weekend i was peeing every hour with bladder pressure on monday i went to urgent care my urine was negative for a uti but i was prescribed antibiotics anyway for preventative measures the antibiotics made me feel horrible dizzy nauseous and weak i stopped taking them after the first day and felt pain in my back i ended up going to the er concerned that the infection had gotten worse the hospital did a ct scan where they told me my kidneys and urinary tract looked fine— even my bloodwork was perfect in the ct they were also able to get a view of my pelvis which they did notify me that they see new growth at the surgical site i was completely devestated because i knew this meant reliving the nightmare i had been through prior i met with my surgeon later that week who told me reoccurrence was rare but possible and told me my options every since meeting with him i’ve felt dizzy and extremely anxious i had a panic attack a few days ago and have moments throughout the day where i feel like nothing is real and i’m going insane i’m constantly crying and i’m scared these feelings won’t go away i’m usually never anxious excercise eat healthy and have never had any past medical issues so i’m concerned

"can anyone relate to this i usually wake up in the mornings with terrible anxiety i take my meds and then take my temp and bp like this morning my bp was something like 13883 with a pulse of 81 so not too bad really my temp was 986

so about an hour later i took my temp again and it was 990 and a halfhour after that it was 991

my anxiety is still pretty bad right now the meds only slightly took the edge off

my question is has anyone else ever had an elevation in thier temp as a result of having really bad anxiety it has been anywhere from 970 to 991 when in gets low it is always really cold in the house right now its about 67 degrees in here

im kind of thinking that when your anxious your metabolism and other processes in the body are in high gear and perhaps this can cause an increase in temp

update i just took it again and it was 989",1

"terrified of moving countries i dont even know what im asking for here i just need to let things out
basically im gonna be moving from one country to another this summer ive moved a lot since i was a child because of parents work and im still a minor so i dont really have a say in any of that terrible relationship with my parents aswell who just refuse to acknowledge any of my mental health problems
the issue here is that 5 months ish ago i spontaneously developed a condition known as crps which for short causes intense pain in an extremity like extremely intense pain with no known cure ive been following treatment like physiotherapy and also some medication
the treatment itself is going really well and thats the issue ive never felt more scared of moving even though ive done this so many times said country im moving to is right next to the one im currently living in so its not that drastic of a change in itself im not even scared about having to adapt at school etc etc ive never had any friends so im not leaving anyone behind and i dont think ill meet anyone in my new school thats not even my issue but what im saying is im so scared of having to stop all treatment for my condition when everything was going so well of course were going to look for doctors asap once we move but ill go a good 23 months without physio or therapy this might be unhealthy but im so attached to the professionals taking care of me theyre the only nice adults in my life so maybe its inevitable that ill get attached to them other than the emotional aspect i know ill have to go through immense pain again back to square one all my doctors told us moving now is a very bad decision i cant even rant to my parents because a few months back i was like yeah i really want to move i dont like it here i dont but i wasnt grasping what that entailed treatment wise and all so theyll tell me its my fault we moved im 16 i cant make decisions like these when will they stop im so scared what if my new doctors arent as nice as these ones i want to get better we were on the good track to figure out a cause for my condition and start treatment also starting treatment like cbt with my therapist which i have a month or so left with her i dont have any family or friends who can support me through this and im only getting few hours of sleep every night and the racing thoughts are getting so repetitive i wish they could stop om just so tired and i wish we could finally settle down somewhere as a family instead of moving like every two years my parents think its nothing for me because i should be used to it no im not im really weak  especially now i actually dont want to move anymore honestly just for these reasons which might sound stupid but thats how it is for me but its too late now",1

"rejected by canva because of my agoraphobia i love canva since 2018 i find joy and peace in making presentations stickers greeting cards announcements and so much more its been my safe creative space

recently applied to their job post as mac helpdesk hybrid set up i was hoping if i can impress them they can give me an exemption i have 3 years of experience being a mac advisor and 6 years as helpdesk

during the initial interview i was very specific that wfh is currently the one works best for me since i have agoraphobia the interviewer assured me that it will not hinder my application as they have pwd employees also ie anxiety

until i reached the final interview one of the team lead doesnt even know what agoraphobia is and so i explained to them nicely and politely i was so eager and excited for that interview to be honest i showed off whatever knowledge i have and present my work achievements also they said they are very impressed with me but unfortunately they cant take me in cause they wanted someone who can work onsite i mean it shattered my dream felt bad for having agoraphobia

dont get me wrong im practicing exposure therapy and improving little by little but as much as i want to save myself from having panic attacks i also want to save my coworkers as i dont want to be a burden to anyone

i just wish more real opportunities can be provided for people with mental health issues not just an ad that they are accepting pwd’s but ended up rejecting them we can still do amazing things though with limitations but i can assure you we can give morethan 100 of ourselves if given the chance

for now i will focus on improving myself and still hope to be part of canva someday ❤️",1

"can’t stop thinking about if i should do an abortion 
hi i kept pushing my ex to keep seeing me after we broke up

i then got pregnant from our hookups

i was going to do an abortion

but i took the first pill and became so guilty for doing it i reversed it with the progesterone shots

now i’m about 13 weeks and i feel like i should do the surgical abortion i can’t take care of a kid and mostly i don’t want to i need to finish school i need to make money i need to save up a ton of money

my ex thinks i have aborted the kid but if i end up keeping the kid he’ll find out the kid is here with the child support paperwork 

anyways i don’t know what to do after i took the first pill there was a hotline where it say reverse abortion pill if you haven’t took the second set of pills you could still reverse 

this creepy super pushy pro life old nurse made me feel so guilty if i continued with the abortion and forced me into getting the shots she was like do you really want to be a killer

i was like wtf no and now here i am in a worse predicament now probably needing to do the surgical abortion

i don’t know what to do
i live with my parents definitely going to need to move out if i keep the baby
i have 5k in credit card debt
i use my parents car so i’m going to need a new car

yes i have reached out to let them live they are okay but they remind me of the pushy pro life nurse the girl who’s speaking with me seems to not even care about me but just listen she says “i’m sorry to hear that” in the fakest tone honestly i don’t like them they do nothing for me i have found the resources they found me for me before i contacted them they also push me not to schedule my abortion and say “i think you’ll be a great mom” and they don’t even know me like it’s so fake it makes me want to do an abortion more bc the people that are pro life are like zapped robots again i’m sorry for saying that but that is how they talk

i really need some advice some support i have no friends no family support no one i’m usually going thru life alone but it’s harder now that i have a huge responsibility please reddit can you help me with this how do you think on this 

i am not doing adoption because i don’t want my blood baby being in someone’s hands 

some info on my ex i have really harassed him not going to lie i pushed him so hard to see me after we broke up it was really disgusting i didn’t want to hook up i just wanted to hang out 

but he said if u wana hang out we’re having sex then i’m leaving and that’s when i got pregnant we would have unprotected sex for months  i never got pregnant 

we broke up bc i got super mad at a text on his phone he sent to some girl and the way i got mad pissed him off and he ended it i regret it so much how i acted i wish i just acted normal i wish i acted as if i never read it i miss him so much like incredibly i wish i tried harder to be a girl he wants

seeking advice  so some background last year i had started a sedentary job and began working out and dieting to help manage stress there i also quit drinking not long before starting that job the job wound causing me so much stress that i wound taking multiple hospital visits and started seeing a counselor regularly that all helped until the holiday season which is personally difficult as ive lost many loved ones around that time i wound up relapsing and my counselor at the time kept coming up with excuses to not see me for two months wound up only seeing the counselor like 3 times in 2024 because again he became very unprofessional and went as far as to double book my appointment and not tell me causing me to waste 60 in uber rides to the last appointment that never happened well i wound up leaving the call center job to go work at a dollar general market that opened up 5 minutes from my house not far from where i grew up and i feel this has been a mistake i get paid more and get more hours at dg market but im more stressed than ever my aunt and her husband have recently told myself and other family members that they dont want custody of my sister anymore because my sister is entering her teenage years the thing is that there is no one else that can get custody of her in the family meaning that she would assuredly be placed in foster care i feel as though its time for me to leave this town and start over somewhere else because i feel like ive burned too many bridges here and really just want to live somewhere remote with as little stress as possible im unsure of where to post this other than here as ive only started using reddit regularly in the last year or so,1

"can effects of stress hit after a month  i know i am not pregnant i cannot get pregnant from precum on fingers however i stressed over it for a month last may and i still think momentarily if i really am pregnant

stupid but this pregnancy scare caused me to fall under so much stress 

i started eating less last may i could not even remember how much i ate that month because i just know that i was so stressed as fuck i remember waking up and feel like my stomach is full i could not eat a proper meal and i am now aware that i neglected myself 

i am not diagnosed with anxiety but the constant worry and fear might be due to anxiety it caused me to function less and be unproductive 

now that its june i am constipated and i often feel something hard on my lower left abdomen and even at the side of my belly button left side 

is it possible for so much stress to cause this kind of effect on the body i dont really feel all these things last may but now i feel like all the neglect i did on my body last may took a toll on my body this month ",1
"bad anxiety about death sometimes out of no where while i’m enjoying my day doing whatever the thought of death will slip into my head and then i start overthinking it and it’s hard for me to get my mind off of it i’m so scared of dying… knowing everything and everyone i know and love in life could be gone in a split second just like that and then fearing what comes after death as well and it’s not even just that it’s the fact that i know death is inevitable that’s what really scares me knowing one day i for sure will no longer exist and that every single day i get closer to that day i hate that this feeling creeps up on me out of no where all the time and i wish it didn’t consume me so much 

i’m not sure if this is the same thing or similar to that random sense of impending doom people sometimes get but i really hate it i’ll be happy laughing hanging with friends and the thought enters into my head out of no where and changes my whole mood

is there anyone else who can relate and does anyone have any advicetips for this",1
i used to be absolutely terrified of flying 2 years ago but i just got off the plane after a 48 hour work trip and have another flight in less than a week i’m very proud of myself i have a success story i used to have really bad flying anxiety about 2 years ago my anxiety and ocd was at an all time high and i flew for the first time since covid i went on my first flight in a long time it was a long flight too 4 and a half hours and my anxiety was so bad my brain was spiraling and it was so embarrassing because i looked visibly very anxious turns out i made it through i just got off a plane today and have realized i’ve made such great progress when it comes to flights i have to take a flight that’s almost 5 hours next week too and i fly back a week later  i make sure to bring everything that makes me feel present  i love stuffed animals so i held onto that and had a comfy neck pillow and watched a good tv show to keep me busy the intrusive thoughts were there but i remembered i’ve made it through every plane ride i’ve ever taken so that kept me going and just hugged my stuffed animal when i felt anxious it was even a bumpy ride so much that they never took off the seatbelt sign i hope i can inspire others that it gets better ,1
"severe anxiety is ruining my life the history of my anxiety goes back 14 years two psychologists a month in a psychoneurological dispensary and many missed opportunities i will omit many details and events and try to be as brief as possible and sorry for my english

it all started when i was 14 years old suddenly one summer day i began to experience strong unreasonable fear it was a very strange feeling  not understanding what you were afraid of which provoked even greater fear the child psychologist i started to visit made me draw pictures and yawned when i talked about my problems and soon i stopped seeing her and although the anxiety did not go away i gradually got used to it  it was just always in the background giving my life a very gloomy shade but i could live with it  
over time anxiety began to kinda cling to various reasons for example i once had a severe anxiety attack when i couldn’t understand a physics topic for a long time i was afraid that i would get a bad grade on test and they would keep me for a second year although before that i had never had any serious problems with my studies and grades didn’t bother me much some reasons of my anxiety were very strange and peculiar  for example once the thought occurred to me that the entire world around me was unreal and was a figment of my imagination this thought is one and a half months plunged me into the abyss of some kind of hell i was very scared perhaps this was somehow connected with the loneliness that resulted from such a picture of the world it is difficult to explain  
somewhere around this time i was 15 a second psychologist appeared in my life she helped me a lot every week i came to her with a new bunch of worries and left with a feeling of great relief but a week later everything repeated itself after visiting her for several years i realized that although she helped me a lot she didn’t teach me how to deal with anxiety on my own i was still absolutely helpless in those moments when i had these anxiety attacks i was not given any diagnosis although i talked with a psychiatrist and he told me that i have no deviations in psychiatry

after i turned 18 these attacks began to happen much less frequently and in everyday life i rarely worry about anything perhaps because i have built my life in such a way that there is no room for surprises and unknowns but when they happen i still cant help myself anxiety had a particularly dramatic impact on my studies and as a result my career  
i did well at school and i was especially good at math after school i entered the faculty of economics was one of the best students but after 2 years i realized that i didnt like economics i changed my faculty to mathematics but decided to study remotely on my own in my country there are no programms in pure math i outlined a study plan for myself but soon i realized that i couldn’t cope at the pace that i set for myself for several months i tried to read textbooks despite my anxiety but it only intensified and made understanding impossible as a result anxiety again accelerated to such limits that i could not sleep eat work  nothing thats how i ended up in a psychoneurological clinic for a month the official diagnosis was moderate depressive episode when i returned home i was unable to return to studying i had big problems with attention i started playing computer games escaping reality every time i asked myself “when will you continue studying” i told myself “soon” and still did nothing i was studying at the university but in my country such distance programs have almost no requirements for passing exams and don’t teach anything in fact you just come once every half year and fulfill the minimum list of requirements then forget about it for another half a year  
finally i realised that theoretical math is probably for hardworking geniuses defenitely not for me and i decided to try my hand at programming i took different courses related to programming at the university and they did not cause me any difficulties but i couldn’t completely abandon the idea of ​​math i really love math so i decided to try myself in the area at the junction of both  in data science i found twoyear free courses and started preparing myself for entry exams it was very difficult to enroll i had to learn olympiad mathematics and programming algorithms linear algebra probability theory etc the studying was going very poorly i still had big problems with anxiety and procrastination i rarely managed to study more than 3 hours a day as a result i prepared very poorly and didnt know a lot of things required for these courses but miraculously i managed to pass the exam on the second try i was 25 i thought that now under constant deadlines among people who are interested in the same things i can finally overcome my apathy get a profession and find a job how wrong i was

i heard before that the courses were difficult they are conducted by a huge it company the local equivalent of google and only 50 percent of those enrolled complete them but somehow after all my failures i still was pretty selfconfedent or just didnt realise the level of difficulty probably both in the first days of studying i felt the bells of good old panic as soon as i received a task that i didn’t fully understand how to do i still had little experience in programming and everything was very difficult for me on average these courses take 3040 hours a week but again i spent almost all of my time worrying i didnt sleep well 247 the hammer knocked in my head “i can’t keep up” and as a result after a month i realized that i would not be able to pass at least one course out of the required three i felt terrible it was another failure and it seemed that i had missed my last chance in life the situation was aggravated by the fact that during the courses i was surrounded by very smart students who seemed to grasp everything on the fly and did everything 5 times faster than me i felt myself stupid and lost by the end of the semester i was able to complete two courses out of the required three but even this was done under everyday monstrous panic i had to leave the courses

now im 28 ive been working as a math tutor for the last 8 years but in my country this job doesnt pay well and i cant afford much i avoid studying and looking for a job in it because the very thought of it causes a strong uncontrollable anxiety attack there is a picture in my head even if i get a job i wont be able to work they will give me tasks but i will not cope with them because panic leaves no room for thinking i will get up in the morning sit down at the computer open task and then an avalanche of thoughts will descend on me “i can’t cope i’m worthless my life has no value” accompanied by such strong anxiety that i won’t be able to do anything in the end i will drive myself into severe depression i will be fired and after that i will lose my last hope that i can achieve anything in life

oh that was very long thank you for reading i would be grateful for your thoughts on this whole situation",1
"anxiety  26m overall healthy male i’ve had some debilitating anxiety when it comes to health issues right around the start of the covid pandemic it subsided and went away for a few years and recently in january it came back  i’ve been trying to quit caffeine nicotine and habits that are not super productive for me because i thought that was what was leading to it

i’ve cut all that out and only drink water all day and i still have debilitating anxiety regarding health 

i recently found i have a few lesions on my liver and i’m not sure if they are dangerous or could be flash fillings from contrast or something like that  it’s been ongoing for about a month recently i’ve started having pain in my abdominals and i can’t tell if it’s from anxiety of constantly worrying and thinking about those lesions or if there is something there

i used to compete in kickboxing a year ago to the date i had my last match and ever since then i’ve been hit with loss after loss

my grandfather died in september 

i got covid in january 

from that point i’ve had extreme anxiety 

three weeks ago i totaled my vehicle  and my insurance was lapsed  which i didn’t realize due to card fraud

after the accident the hospital found the lesions on my liver 

a week after that someone backed into my fiancé’s car while i was driving and smashed the front end 

it seems like it’s just been hit and break in between 

i just feel overwhelmed and i constantly keep waking up and thinking about the future with my fiancé and myself and how i just wanna be a dad and a husband and provide a good life for her and i just feel so scared and worried that i wouldn’t be able to do that  it haunts me it eats me  alive at work all day 

i’m not a victim and i don’t feel sorry for myself i just can’t tell if i’m going crazy or if these health issues are actually there

sometimes i look at the big picture and i just think either way it’s unfortunate and i just want to be better and be my old self

i used to work out all the time now it’s been like 6 months and i feel outta shape and exhausted whenever i try ",1

she has so much expectations from everyone around her thats why she is always upset with people all her friends are busy in their lives she feels very lonely  she has extreme emotions  sometimes too too happy and the other times she cries for her death she has so much anxiety and she panics at literally everything 

she knows she needs medical attention but she says she doesnt have money for therapy and even if she would have  she feels she cannot open up to a stranger  she loves me alot and so do i but she wants to talk to me for hours and hours even when i have to study for my exams  she wants to do everything with me  discussing her shopping  her art work  her looks  no matter how hard i convince her she is beautiful she is pretty she is still so insecure and needs tons of compliments  she stands in front of the mirror for hours and ask me tiniest details like how is her skin looking  is there any difference in her pimples  jawline  skin colour  every single day   it frustrates me and irritates me because she becomes too clingy and i feel i have a life too  but then i think i am being selfish because she has also done alot for me  she has been very helpful to me and  that i should be there for my sister  

even though after pushing my self hard  even after talking to her for hours when i say i have to do something else or we could talk later she gets upset and says that she needs me to talk more  that makes me feel exhausted  or even if we aint talking she wants my presence all the time  ik she needs me and i should be there for my sister but now it is frustrating me alot  she is sometimes so so grateful and shows alot of gratitude to me and sometimes straight up denies all my efforts saying i have never been there for her 

her mood swings her expectations everything is becoming so difficult for me and i cant see her cry as well

idk how to handle this  i feel so guilty all the time  any advice what i could do in this situation  ",1

just started lexapro hello so my doctor has me on 10mg for 7 days and 20mg thereafter what i noticed today after only 3 10mg pills 3 days was running late to meet someone and usually my anxiety shoots to 10 scale tying to rush drive there think navigate pulse and mind racing so today i consciously created a mental marker on the drive there to reflect how i usually feel at that particular moment in that same exact situation vs what i was feeling at that particular moment it felt like my mind and body knew the anxiety that i always have in that same exact situation was really still there but there was a blanket on top of it to change my reaction to it to hide it somehow but my mind still knows it’s there or believes it should be there so it becomes a belief that it is which was a very weird feeling for me with a sort of dual reality vs on or off the drug and what it does positive but also like hmmm this feels very unusual and unexpected guess i’m not expecting miracles with any drug as i haven’t been on many medications before this i’m the type of person that doesn’t accept things like cruise control in cars bc i like knowing i’m in control and that could be an issue here or it may pass now there were much deeper reasons for getting on the drug not for being late but just wanted to share my starting experience other things have been extremely tired even taking it before bedtime like someone sprinkled sleepy powder on me throughout the day but have been forcing myself to get up and get out play tennis and mountain bike this weekend bc don’t like the idea of anything taking over also have had some diarrhea that will hopefully clear itself up did have a headache and took two aspirin the day before i started lexapro which read that it’s not good to take while on it so i’m a little concerned what i’m supposed to take when have headaches bc ibuprofen usually doesn’t work for me ,1

"difficult timing  im currently dealing with the loss of a friend of over eight years she recently left a place we used to work at together due to being hurt by a comment someone made towards her she often has difficulty resolving conflicts and as a result she abruptly left shortly before her departure she called me and told me about the plans she had at the job i found out that she didnt really want to leave as she told everyone it was for a different reason she was just unable to resolve the situation 

 ive seen her in public once for sure and possibly today at the supermarket since we dont live far from each other the first time was on a check outline once she realized it was me she moved away quickly to the next line the second sighting possibly today she saw me as i was coming down an escalator at whole foods and she turned around facing the produce and texting on the phone the reason its hard to recognize her is because she always wears a mask and a hood or a hat 

the somewhat funny thing is that we both have social anxiety and she wont reach out to me and vice versa however her absence has really triggered me i was already having a difficult time prior to this and this just gave me the boost i really needed sarcasm  to be honest id never thought id miss her so much and im having a difficult time reaching out since shes avoiding me i thought itd be better to just give her space 

i know not reaching out to her is due to my own fear of loss coupled with the fear on her face from seeing me and her detachment from me and others in that space

as i mentioned im currently struggling with my own anxiety and im going to therapy and going out with friends and overall trying to keep busy i know these things take time  this relationship is just something thats been constantly eating at me for a while and making my face go like this  thats my going insane face

i know from experience that if i offer solutions shell get angry with me if i call her it will only ramp her up more if i take the rest of the day off and go home shell just be angry that i did that all i can do is listen and reflect her words back to her but im still left anxious 

one wrong word when i get home and shell be triggered to hell and back she lashes out for someone to blame anyone who makes a wrong move is the cause of all her life dreams not coming to fruition

im powerless and dont know what to do the only thing i can do is continue working and try to focus until i can get home

may 2017

as the clock struck 655 pm on a mundane monday evening i found myself grappling with the fragments of my shattered reality a few days ago in a haze of desperation and curiosity i delved into the abyss of drug experimentation unaware of the impending chaos that would ensue trapped in a whirlwind of impulsive decisions and a misguided search for euphoria i embarked on a perilous journey fueled by ignorance and desperation

the allure of a makeshift high beckoned from the depths of our medicine cabinet tempting me with promises of a fleeting escape from the confines of my troubled mind with reckless abandon i reached for the nausea pills containing dramamine oblivious to the pandoras box i was about to open little did i know the line between euphoria and madness was perilously thin blurred by the potent cocktail of chemicals coursing through my veins

in the grip of intoxication i surrendered to a kaleidoscope of hallucinations each more sinister than the last reality warped and twisted morphing into a nightmarish landscape devoid of coherence or solace the peaceful high i had naively anticipated gave way to a haunting descent into the depths of druginduced psychosis

hours melded into days each moment a hazy blur of fragmented memories and fleeting lucidity the pills once a beacon of escape became shackles binding me to a harrowing reality i could scarcely comprehend as i traversed the labyrinth of my fractured mind i grappled with the terrifying realization that a single misstep could plunge me into the abyss of irreparable damage

the discovery of my mothers potent oxy pills nestled among my sheets served as a chilling reminder of the precarious precipice upon which i teetered the consequences of my reckless indulgence loomed ominously threatening to unravel the very fabric of my being

alone with my thoughts i surrendered to the cacophony of voices echoing through the corridors of my mind vivid hallucinations danced before my eyes beckoning me into a surreal realm where the boundaries of reality dissolved into oblivion with each passing moment i battled to discern truth from illusion clinging to the vestiges of sanity that eluded my grasp

in a desperate bid for salvation i reached out to loved ones their voices a lifeline amidst the chaos engulfing me yet even their reassurances could not quell the storm raging within time stretched and contorted its passage a cruel mockery of the linear reality i once knew

as the haze of intoxication gradually lifted i confronted the stark reality of my actions with a newfound clarity the toll of my recklessness weighed heavy upon my conscience a stark reminder of the fragility of the human psyche in the face of chemical temptation

today as i stand on the precipice of redemption i am acutely aware of the dangers that lurk beneath the veneer of euphoria the journey to recovery is fraught with peril yet i am determined to confront my demons headon with the unwavering support of my family and the promise of a brighter tomorrow i embark on a quest for healing and redemption

may my story serve as a cautionary tale a testament to the perils of drug experimentation and the indomitable resilience of the human spirit for in the crucible of adversity we discover the strength to rise from the ashes and forge a new path towards a brighter future

"i hate sleepovers and my best friends love them i have always hated sleepovers except with my boyfriend of 6 years no matter how drunk i get or how late i’m out being alone at the end of the night is always so glorious i have 2 best friends who are sisters close in age they were always super close and hungout with each other day and night they also went to boarding school for high school and dormed in college they’re super familiar with being in close quarters with other girls constantly 

i have 2 older siblings that are 7 and 11 years older than me i’ve always loved being alone i’ve always hungout with my best friends once a week for a few hours at a time and that was perfectly enough for me i commuted to college because i specifically did not want to dorm the only person i am comfortable spending nearly as much time as a roommate with is my boyfriend because i love him in a romantic way i get a horrible feeling spending the night with friends 

i have ocd and while i don’t think that’s entirely the reason i hate sleepovers it certainly adds to it because i have an extensive routine my sleep gets messed with so easily etc if i sleep in a new place i almost always wake up screaming in the middle of the night 

i have told my best friends this many times they are very sweet and try to accomodate me they have me sleep in a spare room and understand when i lock the door but i still get horrible sleep i also don’t really like when they sleepover my house either it’s a little better but i still can’t do my routine on my time when i need to i move very quickly and they move slower if i tell them i want to go to sleep it’ll be another half hour before they get out of my room i just want my bed and to wake up in the morning and do my own routine in my own home sleepovers just make me feel trapped and for some reason they make me feel gross 

but literally every weekend they ask me to sleepover even though they know how much i dislike them they’ll say “you can have the spare room and there’s a lock on the door and i’ll make you a matcha in the morning etc” none of these things make it better and i don’t know how to tell them the only thing that makes me comfortable sleeping is being by myself or with my romantic partner i want them to stop asking but i don’t want it to be awkward i’m happy to hangout until late at night but i’m tired of having to make excuses for me to go home or them to go home and i’m tired of explaining how my brain works i’d just like them to stop asking i feel like as an adult 21f sleepovers really aren’t necessary if anything i feel like adult friends usually only hangout for a few hours at a time and then go back to their adult lives and i spend the majority of my free time with them also not something i really want to do as i work long hours at a labor intensive job how do i explain to them that i never want to have a sleepover without being a buzzkill",1

i only find it takes me a few seconds to complete these and then the bad thoughts continue

"would anyone be willing to share their mirtazapine success stories would really appreciate any mirtazapine success stories  
i am a 23 year old 6 155 pound male with anxiety ocd and depression that was previously very manageable through therapy alone but a couple months ago exploded in intensity to a debilitating extent and i started having daily panic attacks and feelings of intense doom and despair  
my doctor prescribed mirtazapine for me to try instead of ssri due to my fear of sexual side effects and also because i had a slightly bad experience with lexapro as a teenager which kind of turned me off towards ssris also because the side effects of mirtazapine could actually be beneficial to me since i struggle with sleep and also severely struggle with appetitie  
i took my first dose of mirtazapine last night only 75 to get my body used to it until i go up higher and today i actually feel the best ive felt in weeks still some anxiety and depression but less intense however my ocd got me to start seeking out negative reviews online and i came across plenty of people saying this drug did nothing for them or made them worse which kind of made me afraid and made me think maybe this drug wont help for anxiety and depression and that i should switch to an ssri immediately

job guilt i am currently in nursing school so over the summer i just started a job at a nursing home for some experience i am 20 but have no experience with handson healthcare yet so these past two weeks i’ve been training for this job on the weekends it’s very tedious and for the dayshift last weekend the ladies that worked there that were training me were super helpful and explained everything thoroughly to me since i had no former experience i have to do things like change the elderly briefs and diapers help them get to the bathroom and sit on the toilet shower them and wash them and help them with meals because i have no previous experience this has been a big adjustment this weekend i trained on night shift i was working with two different ladies that i hadn’t worked with before my first shift was ok my second shift was really tough because i had to do a lot that i was not trained to do because the ladies expected me to know what i was doing even though i had no experience beside the past weekend i am also a slower learner so it takes me some more time to learn and a thorough explanation for what to do for each patient so that i know that i don’t do anything wrong they would just send me to do tasks without specifying what to do and would get annoyed if i asked any further questions tonight was supposed to be my last day of training but at 7 am this morning i sent an email to the scheduler and asked if i could do my shift another day because i have another job in the morning that i would have to go directly to right after a 12 hour shift i just feel super guilty because i was supposed to give someone a shower today on my shift and i told the ladies that i was working with i would do it and now it seems like i’m only taking a break from today because i didn’t want to do that or i couldn’t handle it anyway this whole night shift experience has been really discouraging and it made me think that i might not be capable of this type of healthcare job on the other hand when i was doing dayshift last weekend i felt a lot more capable because the people i was working with were very helpful and made me think i was capable and would help me and make me feel comfortable what should i do to make myself feel better less guilty about not going to the shift tonight these past two nights have made me not ever want to go back does on what i should do about this job,1

"my classmates think i am a creep but i cant prove i am not i am an international student and i have history of anxiety and depression i was on meds for an year two years ago i came to canada to do my masters initially it was all good but on one day while i was walking on a street a random stranger was acting weird by coming in and out of my sight alternatively in both sides behind me i fret and kept an eye on him and suddenly from behind he tried to attack me i barely dodged it i ran away quickly to place where many people were there this incident has triggered me anxiety and panic i never reported or did anything about this

now in my class there was this girl who always sat infront of me diagonally i never noticed earlier but she was always making sudden movements looking back dont know why this has triggered my anxiety and panic and hypervigilance my mind would switch to fight or flight kind of mode even without my control i would keep tabs on her from corner of my eye i try not to but my anxiety and panic mind could never be controlled i think at some point she picked that im looking at her from corner of eye i feel bad because of fearing what she might think of me i changed my seating place finally it was all good but even in my new place another girl who sat triggered my anxiety due to her sudden movements its becoming tough to me i changed places but i noticed that this girl is also staring at me occasionally and i feel atrociously bad for sending such signals i never have any kind of feelings or anything like that now i suspect or think others are also picking on that i am kind of a creep staring at women etc i am changing my places and avoided seating near women st all due to this fear but i cant control my anxiety as i always fear due to the aggression attack i faced two months back

"panic attack hello reddit
 does this sound like a panic attack 

friday night i had just fallen asleep  i woke up about an hour later with chest pain heart palpitations could not breath could barely stand  

went to the emergency room thinking i was having a heart attack  did blood work and tests and it was determined i was not having a heart attack  i also had a sonogram but the tech seemed to be struggling as i have breast implants with apparently causes “shadows” in the sono  that makes me a little nervous that they may have not had an accurate view of my heart  

anyway follow up with a regular cardiologist on monday since i do frequently wake up with heart palpitations however not as extreme as the other night  

doctor at er said could possibly be a panic attack although didn’t really talk too much about it just sent me home  

hoping it was a panic attack and not a heart issue  i’ll have more answers after seeing the cardiologist but in the meantime does this sound like a panic attack

"i just cant write the stupid email  i was in contact with a professor about phd applications in the spring and i havent been able to respond to the last email i received in early april asking me for a few sentences about what i want to research because of my stupid anxiety i even have a somewhat coherent idea of what i want to work on but i feel like i cant word it perfectly and it just feels like a verbal manifestation of a manic conspiracy board with all the red string in the box every time i think about it i end up with an anxiety attack that leads to a depressive suicidal spiral

and it doesnt help that ive been dealing with a medical issue these last few weeks it feels so pointless to even try and send that email at this point since the professor has probably lost interest in working with me at this point and thinks im unreliable lazy and incompetent and i guess it wouldnt be wrong when i cant even respond to an email ugh the more i spiral and think about my research topic it seems worthless and im better off dead instead of pursuing anything my health isnt improving and the future i want for myself seems impossible

"i hate sleepless nights i hate when i can’t sleep in the night i especially hate it if i didn’t sleep well the night before

my body is all wound up two hours before i have to go to work the constant circleback of drowsiness muscle fatigue paralysis and the eventual lucid phase you would think i’d be able to fall asleep by now lying in bed and allowing my thoughts to wander but that’s precisely what then wakes me right back up

i was counting down the hours 1130 pm last night i thought i was going to do okay look up a few games or play on my phone i set it down at 1200 am i can at least get four hours sleep 

if i go to sleep right now i could get a full four hours of sleep just maybe…

so i lay there and close my eyes only to then have visions of scuba diving…falling below the surface and running out of air i see hands pulling me under i see the waters change the pressure build and the view around me spinning is that what it feels like to have nitrogen narcosis

i’m freaking out and jolt awake again nightmares i decide to distract myself with asmr it’s no help i then try to lay down again and close my eyes 

1 2 3 hours pass nothing

what i’d give for just a little bit of sleep how i wish time would stop i want to wind back the clock for only a few hours so i can maybe have a drop of slumber that’s all i want i feel like oliver twist searching for nocturnal crumbs and yet no matter how much i toss and turn and distract myself or beg whatever is out there for mercy i did not fall asleep

"anxiety from past trauma trigger warning too

  
i am and have been having a very hard time attempting to process this and attempt to understand this everything is foggy and just dosent make complete sense to me

  
when i was 8 years old my dad left to go move to australia with this woman he met online after this was apparently i say apparently cause i dont fully remember and was told this by my mom and other family members  when all my behavior issues started i started bed wetting and that didnt stop until i was around 20 years old i had to be put on medication to help stop it i started self harming by cutting picking at skin and even pulling out my hair i was incredibly destructive when i would talk on the phone with my dad not just to myself but to furniture around the house i do remember carving stuff into my moms chair legs at the table

  
around i guess freshman year of high school i went to this church camp where i would tell a counselor there what my dad did to me when we got back home from the trip i apparently wanted to go talk to my churches priest but he was busy so i told my mom instead

  
my mom said after i told her it all made sense the behavior issues self harming bed wetting etc she even said that i knew details of how he did things so from there well fast forward to about 5 years ago where i somewhat have a relationship with my father i eventually get the courage to talk to him about my accusation and he denies every bit of it so i guess i got it in my head that it never happened and told my mom i lied about the whole thing because i was mad at him for leaving when i was 8 

  
my mom was incredibly confused and asked why i thought i lied about the whole thing i told her cause i dont remember anything happening like that so we had a sit down talk and she asked me if i remember cps coming to the house and interviewing the whole family i said no she asked if i remembered how she came into the bathroom once cause i was taking a long time to shower and she found me covered head to toe in scabs from picking i said no she asked if i remember telling my step dad ill never call or see him as a dad because of what dads do i said no 

  
after this conversation i fell into a depressive state for a bit wondering how i could forget all of these huge things that apparently happened was getting angry at myself for forgetting and just trying to figure it out

well fast forward to this year where i find out that he could potentially be coming back to the us ill be 32 this year havent seen him since i was 8 his then wife has passed away his mother my grandmother no longer has memory of any of her family and he now has a girlfriend that lives in florida h has indicated that he wants to visit me and meet my boyfriend and friends has even asked to stay with me at my place and asked if i can pick him up from the airport as well 

  
my mother is livid to say the least and i have no fucking clue on how im feeling none and its really getting to me again when i talk to him and video chat i can feel my body getting anxious and tense and like a feeling of dread but my mind is just confused as hell idk what the hell is true anymore the idea of seeing him again gives me many many emotions excited cause hes my dad and i havent seen him in so long terrified of a flood of memories just coming back scared to see him again after all these years many questions like why now why not visit when my grandmother still knew who we all are anger but not sure why

  
has anyone else felt like this or gone through something like this any advice on how i should handle this idk i am currently seeking a therapist i also have my amazing boyfriend as a support system and of course my mom and friends

  
if you happened to of read all this thank you i appreciate it its a mess of thoughts lol ",1

i have been having a hard time sleeping for the past few weeks and it creates a lot of anxiety i notice that when i get these bursts of dysregulation my chest feels like its getting hollowed out and my heart pumps faster 

the part that concerns me is that whenever i get like that and i place my fingers on a random part of my body i can feel my pulse very intensely 

it started when i placed my hand on my chest and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of me i moved my hand to my throat and felt the beating follow so i put my hand on my head and it followed again  

i tested it out when i got another burst of anxiety and i touched my shoulder even my thigh and it was the same thing

"freaking out after ent wants ct scan for my lymph node 
i got an ultrasound on my neck because i felt a lump under my jaw i’ve had it for quite a while i’m not sure why the radiologist couldn’t determine whether it’s one or two lymph nodes and she didn’t note whether there were any concerning characteristics or not 

findings 
in the area of patient palpable concern there are 2 adjacent lymph nodes measuring 16 x 04 x 09 cm and 1 x 04 x 09 cm versus 1 lymph node measuring 24 x 05 x 09 cm short axis measurement is 04 or 05 cm in between the submandibular and parotid glands
 
on the left side for comparison there is a lymph node in the same region between the parotid and submandibular glands measuring 14 x 05 x 09 cm
 
impression
in the area of patient palpable concern there are 2 adjacent lymph nodes versus 1 lymph node subcentimeter in short axis

my ent said if it was one lymph node it would be highly concerning for cancer and now i have to go get a ct scan i am extremely worried is it normal for ultrasounds to not determine how many lymph nodes there are why didn’t the radiologist say whether there were concerning characteristics he said 95 chance it’s not cancer but the 5 has me very worried ",1

"getting over gym anxiety to feel safe again trigger warning mentions of suicidal ideation sexual abuse childhood abuse bdd

hello

i need some advice 

i have had suicidal ideation all my life but its been especially bad recently ive had a pretty hard life with childhood abuse and sa continuous and a pretty scarring sa incident as an adult ive had good relationships but some pretty abusive ones too i had however believed i had moved past all that and was living a life free from my past save for my numerous disorders bdd anxiety depression to name a few

long story short recent life events have made it abundantly clear that this is not the case and my unprocessed trauma has bled into my life and affected others in a big way i had hurt my ex partner emotionally and carry massive guilt from it but at this point we have given up trying to repair the relationshippart amicably the knowledge of the pain i had caused themseeing them cryhearing in my head how they had once said they wished i was dead said in anger but i cannot unhear it makes it hard for me to keep trucking along but i dont want to end it and have him knowgive him that trauma on top of everything else so am trying to find the will to live one day at a time

my job is quite difficult and i have always had difficulty forming true friendships that dont devolve into the other side wanting more bc ive always had trouble setting and recognising when a boundary should be made 

that is all to say i dont enjoy many things in my life and never felt like there was much to live for but i had recently picked up yoga and subsequently gone to teacher training where i had felt like i had finally found a group of people who connected with me for me and that i found something i could be passionate about in an environment that was supportive and kind it was also something that i seemed to be good at and that excited me

during discussions with my ex we had often talked about how he felt that the way i dressed in life but especially when doing yoga was obviously in his eyes and he insisted in others too a way to seekinvite validation plus he once mentioned how it yoga teacher was the most sexual hobbyvocation someone could have 

the constant pointing out of how my different outifts highlighted this or that asset in me and others has made me feel incredibly self conscious in a space that once felt free of sexual interest for me and although i am sure now that i was delusional in my thinking having that nonsexualsupportive space to feel good in my self and not hate my body was life changing for me i normally hate the way a look as a result of the bdd and having a space that felt free from sexuality was freeing as a survivor  of sa

working towards being a yoga teacher was going to be my north star but now that the sexuality of the vocation the way i dress and the truth of peoples gazes are front and centre for me i do not feel safe in those spaces anymore i feel like to survive as a yoga teacher i will have to market myself on social media and that used to be a fun concept but now im paralyzed by overthinking and by the fear of being seen as someone who is seeking and encouraging sexual desire

this space no longer feels safe nor free from sexuality and i dont know how to get past it it sounds silly but the loss of what i perceived to be a safe space that in wake of everything thats going on in my life is something that feels insurmountable the thought of going to the studio now fills me with anxiety and fear but the thought of now going gives me a different anxiety because of my bdd every second i am there is torturous but not going feels equally so 

the world feels terrifying like there were obvious threats i never identified at every corner i dont trust in my judgment and my ability to navigate it anymore i feel overwhelmed and that i have nothing left to fight for

i’m trying to get myself into a headspace where i feel safe and free from judgement so i can relax and just let this rip it’s like a weird mental block i’m having like i need permission or i’m doing something wrong as vent art a be kinda hardcore and i think some people even frown upon it i don’t think i ever plan to share or post any of this stuff i might even stick it into the paper shredder when it’s done 

basically has anyone else taken this approach and has it helped with regulating emotionsrewarding at all i really just want the freedom to express myself in private and let some stuff out without feeling judged ",1
"stress or something more serious  i am worried about myself and have been since last may  it all started when i was at a job that i thought i loved but ended up too stressful for me  i thought i could handle it but i couldnt  i made the mistake of being overly independent instead of asking for help at work or home i did things myself which caused problems in my relationships i had a coworker at first that i thought we got along but things escalated when my good supervisor left but now im starting to see why  my coworker decided to get belligerent with me when no management was around she would fight me think company policies were stupid didnt want to follow my direction  she would leave the room when we worked in a medical setting  didnt communicate she was leaving which caused a safety issue to those in our care she even told me she didnt like to be told things by someone in authority and she was older  come to find out management failed to let me know her true job description which could have prevented my poor job performance which was odd because i got previously promoted not to mention or prevent undue stress i would go home upset to the point of tears the tension got worse i got coached and eventually terminated new manager was blind to what was going on and get upset at me  i felt i was wronged and i took the job loss hard  around the same time  my mom was back in my life which ive had a traumatic life because of her and other things  she needed my help which caused me more stress moved in with my husband and i ended up lying to us then she was out of the picture again ive been trying to take care of myself wanting to get pregnant having fights with my husband because i can nag or i get hit with things that affect my mood etc i dont want him to think im constantly unhappy or have issues i went through a period where i nagged him we almost got divorced and the last thing i want to do is lose him because without him im literally a nobody we got a dog that ended up needing a new home due to being hyper that caused me to be stressed we had a pest problem but got better thought that was because of me felt i was going through menopause that caused me to be depressed  was worried about losing my husband had a family emergency my job at first thought was being inconsiderate but later it appeared they werent i was going through crying spells felt my heart was going to stop had periods then skipped a month now im back on track it seemswant to open up but dont know how  feel people think the worse of me and that ill take my husband down wanting to get close to my in laws but so afraid they will leave me or hate me concerned about my husband hes all i have a best friend betraying me feeling i dint matter and if i speak up im selfishor afraid ill be dishonest  dont want to lose my husband miss my sex drive my love for life  we havent had a vacation or a night overnight somewhere in a while just to get away  lately ive been hsving gas neck pain other strange sensations and worried im dying or have cancer or will have a heart attack i want to tell people how i feel but dint want to be a burden or lose more people i am worried about my weight too i dont eat alot of food but still feel really bad about myself and weight  i want to know whats going on stress anxiety or hormones like today i feel really bad about myself  i hope its safe here

"unmedicated extreme anxiety and im going on a trip soon f24 ill be going on a trip soon to visit my father we talk on the phone regularly but we dont have a close relationship especially because hes been emotionally distant for my entire life so talking to him gives me a lot of anxiety but i have to push through every other week because he calls me

now hes arranged a for a trip for me to visit him and i really appreciate it because i love him but interacting with him after not seeing him for years is a major source of anxiety in my life he keeps prying into my personal life knowing im a very reserved person and it makes me feel awful because i set my boundaries of what i want and dont want to talk about and he never respects them think this comes from the time he went through my phone without me knowing and then got super angry when he did but thats a story from another day

im currently unmedicated and havent been to therapy in a few weeks because of money issues but i was wondering of anyone has any advice to deal with my anxiety i know it seems like its not a big deal but its been getting so bad lately as the day of the trip approaches im getting heart palpitations

"people really underestimate just how dehabilitating anxiety is a while ago i saw a post about a guy who was afraid to go into costco and was asking all of these questions that would come across as obvious the comments were all vicious and mean they were all mocking him i couldnt help but feel bad not only for the guy but for myself as well because i found what he posted very relatable im who struggles to do things alone it made me sad to know that people view me this way

i thought if he was suffering from something serious like depression im sure the commenters would not post the things they did but since its just anxiety its fine to make fun of them its hard having severe anxiety and having people mocking you on top of it just makes me sad",1

"sisters anxiety is ruining my familys life and hers help  before i beginplease know that i love my sister very much and want her to be happy and get better im just frustrated and at my breaking point here is the background story with her from childhood up til now


my sister and i are twins and both almost 30 years old we both got a late start in life due to healing from childhood trauma and starting college in mid twenties my sister has been shy all her life but she was functional she did fine in elementary junior high  school had many friends but never a boyfriend and is still a virgin i noticed that she had tantrums a lot and would always make me do the talking for her a lot in certain situations she does have a learning disability and difficulty understanding things when adults speak to her 

fast forward to high school teenage
she seemed more sociable than usual and didnt notice anything unusual other than her still explosive childish tantrums when she didnt get her way we got our first job together at age 18 while still seniors in high school she did seem shy at work but not at school manager at work thought it was strange that my sister would make me do all the talking i thought maybe she just has work anxiety 

at age 20 we got different jobs and worked at different places she worked a very sociable job but got fired 5 months later when she worked this job she was independent and driving on her own and living with grandma the day she got fired she claimed that she saw a written note on her managers desk that talked about her being a problem giving out made up hotel rates to guests etc
who knows if thats the truth but after she lost her job she stopped being independent didnt drive and didnt work for 8 years and started drinking she did go to school and finally finished 2 years ago it took her over a year after graduation to get a job and has been at her current job for 9 months she works from home doing medical coding all this time she was living with grandma my sister doesnt drive and doesnt buy food grandma supports her because my sister cant leave the house due to anxiety

so heres the big part
two months ago my sister started acting bizarre she claims that her anxiety has worsened she gets delusions that she did something wrong when she didnt keeps thinking someone is after her that she will get into trouble she even deleted every account she ever created thinking that someone would hack into her accounts or she would get into trouble she constantly throws tantrums she asked to live with me but i know that she cant support herself and that if i was to get married she would have to live with me and my husband she is too child like to take care of herself she refuses therapy and help i dont know what to do she asked to move in with me and my mom im in the process of buying my first house btw but my mom doesnt want her living with her cause of her poor mental health shes trying to teach my sister to be an adult and cope with her anxiety my sister also cannot speak on the phone with someone out of fear 

my mother wants my sister to move in with me at my new house buy she wont do it she just wants to live rent free and have my mom support her to be honest my sister creeps me out her childlike persona delusions and creepy look just freaks me out there is something wrong with her snd  its getting worse my mother had a breakdown talking to me about her tonight and she is scared my sister is going to be homeless and dead someday

how do i help my sister and does anyone have a clue whats wrong with her she was drug tested months ago and negative

getting out is fine going for walks going to the grocery store etc but i find as soon as i see another couple or notice how everyone has someone with them it sends me into this really sad mood and i immediately just want to go back home

"during meditation you can send out or attract glowing spheres of energy to yourself that are visible to the naked eye there are actually two types of these orbs one is a nonphysical beingspirit or being used as a vehicle for a consciousness    
  

  
the second type that you can also come in contact with are glowingtransparent orbs that are made of energy specifically related to an energyemotionvibrationfrequency that is either being sent out from you or drawn to you  
  

  
these orbs can and have been spotted in photosvideos  
  
    


  
this is what i researched and learned after having experienced multiple contacts with them most of those contacts happened while i was circulating my spiritual energy id even go as far as to say that ever since i started circulating this spiritual energy is when i started noticing them  
  

  
a simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be feltrecognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situationsstimuli eventually you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps  
  

  
during one of my meditation sessions as i was sweeping my whole body up then down with this energy while feeling intense gratitude i saw from my half closed eyes a golden orb the size of a grapefruit approach me and enter my body    


  
that was one of the first times i experienced those orbs in 2013 i still do to this day and i know this was successful thanks to the circulation of that blissful wave    


  
this energy has been acknowledged in many cultures and documented under many names like bioelectricity life force prana chi qi orgone rapture tension aura euphoria ecstasy mana vayus asmr nen intent tummo odic force kriyas pitī frisson ruah spiritual energy secret fire the tingles ondemand quickening voluntary piloerection aether chills spiritual chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help  


  
learning how to do this is really simple here are three written tutorials on how to do so and going more indepth about your spiritual energy

feeling like two completely different people at this point  my anxiety has always been the biggest hindrance in my life but up until the last few years it really only mildly affected me in the sense that it never came in between me and my income and even when the job i worked sucked i felt confident i could do it really well and it gave me pride in something i did that i never felt in any other aspect of my life then i decided i wanted to turn my creativity into my career and became a hairdresser i’m currently on my third apprenticeship because i didn’t have the right teachers but now i have someone who has really made sure i have all of the information and resources i need to do well and now i know definitively that even with all of skills and knowledge i’m still messing up horrendously it seems like when i’m not under the pressure of a real person being in my chair and my instructor being over my shoulder i do a really good job but the second any pressure is applied to the situation my rat brain kicks in and i can’t recall anything i have learned my hands are shaky and i’m fumbling around like i’ve never done this a day in my life it’s getting to the point where something i love gives me constant panic and headaches and i feel like i’ve tried everything i’ve learned in therapy to try and quiet that part of me down and it always overpowers the me that i know i can be how do you guys manage to tone down your physiological symptoms in real time and calm down enough to be able to think logically when you can’t really show that you’re trying to self soothe  ,1

"the three keys to make your success inevitable as someone who has been a hair puller and skin picker since the age of twelve i know how hard it may seem to stop i know how easy it is to fall into the helplessness these disorders bring into our lives i also know the toll it can take on your mind and emotions when you fail and feel that you can’t stop but can’t is a dirty word it is a choice you make saying you can’t gives this disorder full control of your life and actions but you are the captain of this ship not your disorder you are able to figure anything out to do this first believe you can 



if you keep these following three keys in mind when you work towards stopping your picking and pulling you will find success it will take time commitment and a lot of action with that being said here are the three keys to making your success inevitable



key one you need to be fully committed to stopping 

in order to stop picking and pulling you must be completely and utterly committed to doing the required work to do so you have to give 100 of yourself to attain this goal or else it won’t work out anything less than 100 is not good enough and you’ll fall into the gap of failure in which you’ll be stuck it’s that simple if you do fail get up and try again don’t take the failure personally you are trying different things and they won’t always stick right away but if you’re giving it your all you will succeed just keep taking action and moving forward and you’ll get to your destination in perfect timing



key two take committed consistent imperfect action every day to stop if you are not in action you are not committed

when you take action it doesn’t have to be perfect it needs to be committed consistent and imperfect because you are a human navigating a human experience of a disorder that is temporarily paralyzing you but if you take steps daily to move out of it you will succeed in perfect timing no one is going to expect perfection from you that’s your own expectation and it’s not realistic even taking small actions is better than nothing so focus on doing doing doing whenever you get the chance it all adds up at the end



key three burn all bridges that can lead you backward you are committed to stopping therefore there is no going back

i’d never heard of the phrase “burn the boats” have you if you haven’t it basically means to burn all paths backward in order to move forward remove any possible avenue that involves not stopping as they will never lead you to your goal once you start working towards stopping your picking or pulling there is no going back if you truly want to stop you must fully commit yourself to doing it you simply don’t allow yourself to go back if you fail you start again and move forward no matter what your mind tells you you refuse to take the failure personally and you use it to move you in a different direction for your goal your mind is always going to tell you to do the opposite of whatever action is actually going to propel you forward



remember lovely souls it doesn’t matter how you start what matters is how you finish just get started by taking daily action that is consistent committed and imperfect and don’t look back not even for a second you may have picking and pulling deeply engraved as a habit now but you can reverse it and stop i picked and pulled for nearly thirty years but with full commitment to doing the work to stop i’ve climbed my way out of that hole if you’re ready to stop picking and pulling but need some guidance i’m ready to stand up and guide you you have to be willing to be fully committed to doing the work reach out and we’ll discover ways to move forward let’s do this



in addition i have a radically awesome community with free resources and daily content that will help you to overcome this disorder i also have oneonone coaching options and i’m working on group coaching programs and courses as well you’ll find people who are struggling with hair pulling and skin disorders so you’ll make plenty of connections for the community you can check it out here  everyone is welcome ",1

"my new method for digging out of a bad day 1 recognize it  if you dont know why your mood is low continue to take positive steps in any direction 
2 the next step doesnt need to be perfect  example if you have not eaten yet today then eat something even if its not super healthy or even the traditional type of food for that time of day and if that requires you getting a milkshake so be it not that im about to totally do that
3 reassess  find another step you can take no matter how small it is  maybe thats taking a nap to try and reset things or taking a long hot shower  sometimes things like a hot shower that result in full body sensory experience that feels to some anyway calming and cozy help the brain get into a new pattern  basically put everything on the table  no step is too small and dont let tradition social conventions previous patterns get in your way

"what’s the point of living   life have been a living hell

every single day without a day off i have been in a near constant state of fight or flight 

no matter where i’m at or what i’m doing i’ll start to feel my heart rate begin to rise my muscles tense up and a sense of panic takes over even in my “safe” place at home alone in my room

even at night i’m not at peace as i typically get about 5 hours of sleep i constantly wake up in the early hours out of breath and in cold sweats 

normal people don’t have to write an entire mental conversation before talking with someone “just talk more and it’ll go away” 

if only it was that easy

when i start conversations my mind goes blank my face turns red and words become “thick” to spit out and i begin to shake this clearly makes people very uncomfortable to be around me

these negative reinforcements only make my anxiety worse as i know what is to come next time i try 

whenever someone tries to be nice and pity invite me i feel like such a fuck up because i know they don’t want me there for my personality or “vibe” but because they see it as a charity case 

people think i’m not self aware about how i’m “not all the way there” or “off” but i’m hyper aware of my social situation

not trying to sound edgy but i honestly wish i wash never born these mental hurdles are just too much for me and i’m sick of this shit

"how to function as an anxious newlyadult female with agoraphobic tendencies i 18f have been dealing with severe anxiety and depression since i was ten years old i can only assume it’s genetic  both of my parents are unbelievably anxious and paranoid people granted on very opposite ends of the spectrum and practically everyone on my mother’s side of the family has an anxiety disorder i very recently turned 18 and suddenly it feels as though i have the weight on the world on my shoulders and i have no idea what to do or what i even can do

to make a very long story short i have strong agoraphobic tendencies and experience intense paranoia whenever i’m in the presence of someone else whether it be family or close friends people absolutely terrify me and though i know it’s not rational nor based in reality this fear feels so deeply ingrained in me that even after nearly a decade of therapy i haven’t made much progress in stopping it from happening i’ve learnt to suck it up and deal with it to an extent but it leaves me feeling exhausted and hopeless

i don’t really know how i’m meant to function as an adult the only jobs available for someone like me ie a full time student are customer service roles that involve talking to people i worked customer service for a year and that was genuinely the worst i have ever felt i have never felt more unsafe more paranoid and more willing to lock myself in my room forever than i did working that job  and i know for a fact it wasn’t my employers fault my employers were nothing but understanding  it was me who just couldn’t handle it i am not physically fit enough to work most warehouse jobs in my city the idea of working at a cafe and serving customers makes me want to throw up from anxiety no accounting or law firms want to hire a student for any sort of filing or entry level administrative jobs and there are no jobs involving my life passion paintingart i can’t even work as a cleaner because all of the job listings where i live for cleaners or janitors require a drivers license  and what would you know just because life hates me i have an intense phobia of driving… exposure therapy hasn’t helped with that one unfortunately if anything i think it made it worse

of course none of that’s even mentioning potentially moving out in the long run or having to be self sufficient and organise things for myself my mom still has to make phone calls for me because my brain literally refuses to let me speak the moment i’m on call with someone i just want to know how other people have made it work i don’t like being like this and i’ve tried so hard to get better through therapy and medication but i think this is just fundamentally who i am as a person 

in the very least some anxietyfriendly job suggestions that are entry level would be nice i think being employed would be a good starting point in trying to be functional but good god does the world make it hard… ",1

"how to set boundaries with someone hi so i’m just putting this here as i’m in need of a little advice and as the title shows i need to set boundaries with someone

they’ve left me feeling extremely uncomfortable honestly it is my fault for not openly saying anything i never affirmed any of their actions either but i should’ve said something this person has a history of anger issues so i didn’t want to be rude or come across rude

we’ve been friends for years now but strictly online we went to the same school a couple years back but we both went to different schools so never saw one another

i last saw this person last year august where i first started questioning what they thought of our friendship they mentioned my hands being smallsoft taking them and intertwining them i laughed it off and shook off any “do they like me” feelings but i did feel a little odd about it

a month later they had confessed via text to liking me asked to kiss me to which i nicely declined both we still remained friends and never mentioned it again

fast forward to now and i’d honestly been avoiding seeing them every time we made plans i always cancelled i tried to tell myself it wasn’t because they liked me i didn’t like them back they knew that and maybe now they didn’t have those feelings anymore but i kept cancelling and cancelling until it wasn’t fair anymore i felt bad and agreed for them to come to mine where i was most comfortable

they came and it was awkward at first but fine we just chatted etc pretty normal and i’d slowly calmed down my nerves and realised i was being silly we’re just friends

it started when they began saying i looked huggable pretty innocent i laughed it off and changed the subject until they said it again “sorry you just look so huggable” and i was just a bit like…okay that’s fine nothing bad i’m dramatic

i said i didn’t know if i was and they said we should experiment i immediately shut it down and said no and we fell into an awkward silence they seemed embarrassed so i changed subject

i stood up to refill their glass but as i did they did and before i knew it their arms were around me and we were hugging i just hugged them back but honestly felt so uncomfortable we stayed like that for a few minutes

i sat on my bed after which resulted in another hug and them pulling me atop of them i wanted to dissolve and fade into dust at that moment i was pushing myself up not hugging back at that point i moved my head which resulted in a quick cheek kiss

i just sat up and laughed so awkwardly i felt so uncomfortable felt so bad about being uncomfortable i was home alone so i didn’t know what to do

we then went to my kitchen where i sat down at the table they took my hands and held them saying they’re so soft and small and i froze again as they just held my hands and stared at me they mentioned the fact my arms were so far away theirs were across the table and pulled them forwards i then started talking about something else as an excuse to let go 

after that i kept my distance sitting across my room away from them they mentioned it but i just said i liked it and we carried on chatting 

i have a single bed and they kept saying it could fit two people i kept changing the subject but they kept at it saying we could fit in it but they’d have to hold me i ignored it and changed subject again saying if they did stay over which they never will i’d sleep somewhere else they found that strange 

they asked to take selfies together which i agreed and endured a lot arm around the shoulder action and side hugging they came across the room for this and sat directly next to me and didn’t move after that i honestly know i was being dramatic i was just uncomfortable at the time

then they moved across the room again and started taking photos of me saying i looked gorgeous i appreciated it but the amount of photos being taken made me uncomfortable this happened all day just random “you look gorgeous right now i’m taking a picture” they sent the pictures over and i look so uncomfortable in all of them

they did end up moving back beside me and put their leg and arm against mine i watched as they looked at me and looked at me again when i moved away 

i could’ve said more but i’ll cut off here hopefully you get the idea

it’s my fault i’m well aware i needed and should’ve said something i just felt so awkward so i’ve woken up this feeling just feeling funny they sent me pictures from our day and it consisted of every single one  photos i had no knowledge they’d been taking when i wasn’t looking

so does anyone have any advice for me on how to go about this i just want to have a nice easy conversation and set my boundaries clear i don’t want them to think they’ve done anything wrong i’m taking the blame it’s just made me feel all anxious and weird

they have messaged and apologised if they made me uncomfortable so i’m not mad at all thank you for reading

"did i just have a seizure or something  so i dont get panic attacks very often and when i do i even hesitate to call them panic attacks because im usually pretty easily capable of calming down on my own

i am familiar with the feeling of my face and hands starting to tingle a little during a panic attack but this time it sudennly spread from there into my entire body and got so intense that it felt like i was on fire
then my muscles started to cramp up so bad  that i couldnt move my fingers out of turning into fists in fact i couldnt really move at all i was basically rolling around on the floor like a dying caterpillar my face was all scrunched up out of my control too

"is this anxiety or ptsd 

dizziness started in mid november 2021 went to canberra on the 10th of december and i had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation 

dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of december when i nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate went to hospital they did blood work and ecg couldn’t find a probable cause went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident upon my 3rd visit to hospital xray was done off my chest and nothing was found i was bedridden for 6 weeks everyday was a battle for life i felt like i was in septic shock everyday i had to get iv fluids about 10 times because of dehydration i sweated constantly with no appetite for water or food

symptoms 

lightheaded 
dizziness
heart gets tired quickly 
sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb
my head feels tension
heat in my abdomen back and my ears get hot
feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode 
sometimes left shoulder feels warm
my eyes sometimes drop tears randomly
unable to concentrate at times
shortness of breath during episode 
there’s always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area sometimes hits my lower abdomen and i feel nausea makes my stomach make noises i have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when i close my eyes i wake up between 13am with a weird feeling as if i’m scared or something vision sometimes becomes blurry fatigue and tiredness little sudden noises scare me whenever i have a episode that peaks my hands and feet get sweaty and i feel heat my hands and feet sometimes get cold the feeling in my mid left chest area i can’t explain but it’s as if my muscles are vibrating when i stand up it’s seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down same thing happens when i lay down it gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was sometimes i can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well as well as my ears feel the pressure lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head i feel bad 80 of the day really bad 15 of the day and alright 5 of the day


let’s go back to my childhood my earliest memory is probably when i was around 10 if i would focus on my breathing it felt like i couldn’t breath anymore i also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time doctors couldn’t find anything i was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking in highschool a few times i nearly fainted out of the blue sometimes during sports i’ll hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured sometimes over excitement caused this as well

"i just started experiencing “air hunger” and need some advice last night i had a terrible sort of breathing attack which at first i thought was allergies so i took some benadryl but it didn’t seem to do much i started looking around online because i got concerned and i discovered what air hunger was the yawning the anxiety inhaling again before fully exhaling it all matched

i have struggled with mild anxiety my whole life and im currently pretty stressed out about a lot of things so im not surprised this just started the problem i have is that i realized that to me its one of those “thought hazards” that will send my brain spiraling into a terrible cycle of anxiety which makes the breathing worse and even more concerning

after having some time to think about it this last sleepless night i realized that i need to just think about it until im done thinking about it there is no point in trying to not think about it i just need to let it pass over time after exhausting all my brain power on it and suffering for a little bit maybe

my main point i would very much appreciate hearing any and all experiences with air hunger any sort of advice any sort of interesting personal notes that you have really anything i want to read all about it and feel more powerful over it thank you everyone",1

to cope with my stress a few years ago i began smoking weed it really helps relieve my stress but the problem is it’s almost impossible to smoke at my house because my parents are constantly checking in on me opening my door like every hour or so someone will come in keep in mind this is at night during the day i am busy either hanging with them or at work or school once they finally go to bed around midnight i can smoke i keep it to carts to reduce smell my dad has a bloodhound nose the only issue is both my parents wake up throughout the night constantly and will open my door to make sure i am asleep everytime 

the reason i stay up late is so i can have my alone time but i can’t enjoy that because they’re always coming in i love them very much but it is just way too much for me and if i tell them i need privacy i know they’ll be sketched out and ask what i am hiding or why i need this privacy they’re amazing people just very very intrusive and to be fair i have problems sleeping so they’re worried i don’t sleep

"my story and looking for overall advice  hey all 

  
not really sure why i am doing this but i just feel pretty alone and lost at the moment so i thought id throw out my story and experience because this year has been the hardest in my life im not a great writer so i am just going to start typing and hope it isnt too long of a read thanks in advance

ive had issues for all of my life ever since getting diagnosed with ocd in first grade i have been on medications nothing was really that bad until high school where i dealt with some depression after being bullied that got better eventually and all was well through college where i consider myself to be at my happiest i was constantly distracted and surrounded by people i enjoyed hanging out with this is where i also developed a habit of using weed having ocd it wasnt difficult for the weed usage to get out of hand and i basically used it for 4 years straight just over a year ago i graduated college and moved to a new city to start working full time i knew this was going to be a rough time because i didnt know anyone living here and was not too excited about the job either i kept using weed although the amount i used slowed down as i had to be at work for most of the day each week this was also when i started using adderall to help with my adhd long story short i hated the adderall i was overstimulated on everything surrounding me and my own thoughts and it became too much to handle after several months of trying to convince my doctor to let me off of it they finally caved and we started to ween off at the end of the weening off timeline i used a weed pen to get high one day that sent me into a horrible depersonalization panic attack where i thought i was dying i had never experienced anything like it ever before and had no idea how to handle it for the sake of everyones time im going to be a lot less detailed from this point on just because so much has happened between then and now basically i have stopped using weed and have been off of it for over 2 months now i am doing multiple therapy appointments a week and am 4 weeks into taking prozac because we think that will help pull me out of this i am still depersonalized with varying outofbody symptoms each day and my anxiety is as bad as its ever been i can barely go anywhere in public now i can barely socialize do my job basically just function

  
i think it has to do with the depersonalization but the root of all of my panic attacks and me thinking im dying is due to health anxiety i notice a sensation in my body and my brain automatically spirals from then on it has affected me in every aspect of my life i no longer drink coffee i no longer can exercise due to getting nervous about my heart i have even been to the er and been told that my heart is perfectly healthy having an xray and blood test done while i thought i was dying my therapist is stumped and is unsure what will help at this point because we feel like we know what has driven this to be so bad but my brain cannot come to terms with it i feel extremely defeated and each day grow more envious of people that are able to live normal lives i really am not in a spot to quit my job and move back with my parents and i dont even think that would solve it since i still have horrible episodes when i am with them or at my childhood home i dont even think the weed is what caused all of this to be so bad i think i had so much pent up anxiety that was waiting to come out and it all did at once during a horrible panic attack the dp and panic attacks are literally steering my life for me and it scares the shit out of me in terms of how no one seems to have any clues as to how to help 

  
tldr i have been in depersonalization since february and as of 2 months ago have been dealing with panic attacks to the point of where i think i am dying each time unable to go out in public exercise or even just enjoy myself at my apartment alone i have been on prozac for 4 weeks now probably and i understand it takes longer to kick in so i will be patient i have also been on mirtazapine during this time as well ive tried buspar and a few others but nothing seems to do the trick i sincerely thank anyone who takes the time to read this

"overcoming depression and selfdoubt a personal journey scrolling through many out there struggling with signs of depression particularly lack of belief and confidence in themselves i want to share my journey overcoming personal depression and lack of confidence with the hope that it might impact some of you going through similar hardships

previously for a long time i felt like i was trapped in a dark tunnel with no end in sight depression weighed heavily on me and selfdoubt crept into every corner of my mind whispering that i wasnt good enough that i wasnt trying hard enough that i would never amount to anything it was a suffocating feeling even making me feel physically tight in the chest and breathless seeming like there was no way out

but i refused to let these negative thoughts define me i sought help reaching out to friends family and ultimately professional advice opening up about my own struggles was one of the hardest things ive ever done i even shared my issues on my personal blog with people everywhere seeing my vulnerability my desire to break free from it all feeling a bit ashamed but also the most liberated ive ever felt it made me realize that i wasnt alone in this battle and that there were people genuinely concerned about my wellbeing

exploring honesty with myself and receiving guidance from experts was a gamechanger for me it provided me with tools and coping mechanisms to challenge my negative thoughts and develop a more positive outlook on life i learned to cultivate mindfulness be kinder to myself on days when everything felt overwhelming

beyond therapy for the mind i made lifestyle changes to improve my mental health i started exercising regularly prioritizing sleep and nurturing perspectives and beliefs through activities like selfreflection meditation and yoga i even decided to take a break from social media for a while to stop caring about external things and focus on myself these small changes added up and contributed to an overall sense of happiness for me i felt healthier both mentally and physically

but perhaps the most significant change happened within me – a change in perspective i began to see my struggles not as weaknesses but as opportunities for growth each failure became a lesson each challenge an opportunity to prove to myself that i was stronger than i thought

it wasnt an easy journey and there were obstacles along the way there were dark days threatening to engulf me piledup difficulties work and life pressures weighing heavily on my mind and body but i held onto the hope that things would get better if i persevered and didnt give up – and they did

today i can proudly say that my spirit is much stronger ive learned to accept my flaws and imperfections understanding that they make me unique i find joy in simple things and gratitude for every day im gifted especially in seeing advantages in all life situations always helping me develop something

if youre struggling with depression and lack of confidence know that youre not alone reach out for help whether its through counseling support groups or trusted loved ones and remember healing isnt a straight path – there may be ups and downs throughout the process because even for those who dont face these issues there are always pressures and challenges in life to face and overcome

you deserve love and happiness and you deserve to live a fulfilling and authentic life for yourself keep fighting keep believing in yourself and never lose hope",1

anyway super stressed in my personal life and work right now my team leader recently asked if i would take on extra calls i agreed without thinking about it because im a people pleaser and had my 1st round of training for these last week i quickly realised these calls were awful basically i have to call every person who gives a bad rating on a survey to our department and who wants a callback basically every asshole who calls through in our department to try bring up our customer service rating when i realised what these calls were i sent an email to my team lead saying i didnt think i was in the right place to be dealing with that many irate customers right now given recent events ie miscarriage and that my day to day calls were stressful enough im going through fertility testing and have been told stress can stop the body ovulating so to limit my stress etc yep trying to get pregnant again  limited time im old 39

anyways my email was basically ignored i was thrown into more training today for these calls and basically had a mini breakdown and started crying ive never cried on this job im so stressed and i dont know how to make my team leader listen to me on this

any suggestions greatly appreciated im afraid to have the conversation face to face because im angry my concerns have been brushed off and that if i have this conversation face to face i could lose my temper or cry like a crazy person again i hate crying in front of strangers

"struggling with anxiety and perfectionism in new job need advice hey everyone
  
im reaching out because im feeling incredibly overwhelmed and anxious about my new job and i could really use some advice
  
ive always been a perfectionist and ive been proud of my dedication and dependability in all of my previous roles in fact ive frequently found myself covering for lazy coworkers and managers who couldnt be bothered doing their jobs correctly on time while they appreciated my dedication it frequently left me exhausted and stressed but it was also nice to feel appreciated for being useful and worthwhile
  
i recently got a new job that seemed like a dream come true it offered higher pay and more personal control over shift times work attire and personal device use which i thought would be an excellent fit for me as id always felt limited in that area in previous jobs however since starting the job a week ago ive discovered that its far more stressful and demanding than i expected
  
im struggling to keep up with the workload while trying to learn all of the necessary information which also changes weekly my new coworkers have been helpful in answering my questions but theyve also been brutally honest about constantly being confronted with new challenges such as difficult daily targets toxic managers and a lack of hr support i find myself arriving early staying late and even foregoing my lunch breaks in an attempt to catch up but it never seems to be enough for me
   
to make matters worse the stress and anxiety have started to take a toll on my physical health ive been having trouble sleeping and eating due to ibs flareups and i feel like im constantly on edge
  
ive talked to friends and family about how im feeling and theyve suggested that i need to stop putting so much pressure on myself to be the perfect workhorse and start slacking like the rest of the people ive worked with but the thought of not doing my job properly really terrifies me and i cant shake the feeling that if i dont catch up ill be reprimanded by my manager or fired instantly
  
i know i need to strike a balance and prioritise my mental health but im not sure where to begin how can i stop being anxious and become more relaxed and carefree like some of my former coworkers i despise feeling like im failing at my job but i also dislike feeling like im falling apart when i come home and quitting is not an option because it took me so long to find a decent paying job in my area

one of my main coping mechanisms is my dog and even she is not able to bring the life into me lately     i have tried to read a few subreddits and type a little sharing is completely out of my comfort level unless its my therapist

"need help dealing with extreme anxiety  f24 ill be going on a trip soon to visit my father we talk on the phone regularly but we dont have a close relationship especially because hes been emotionally distant for my entire life so talking to him gives me a lot of anxiety but i have to push through every other week because he calls me

now hes arranged a for a trip for me to visit him and i really appreciate it because i love him but interacting with him after not seeing him for years is a major source of anxiety in my life he keeps prying into my personal life knowing im a very reserved person and it makes me feel awful because i set my boundaries of what i want and dont want to talk about and he never respects them think this comes from the time he went through my phone without me knowing and then got super angry when he did but thats a story from another day

im currently unmedicated and havent been to therapy in a few weeks because of money issues but i was wondering of anyone has any advice to deal with my anxiety i know it seems like its not a big deal but its been getting so bad lately as the day of the trip approaches im getting heart palpitations 

i think travelling will be good for me to step out of my comfort zone and i have no problem interacting with other people or going through the airport but staying with him for 2 months sounds like hell to me right now",1
"am i overthinking  i’ve been at a job through a temp agency for about two months  that i actually somewhat enjoy for once the individual who has been training me sung praises to my supervisor and the other day my supervisor approached me about taking the next step if i would like to continue of course i said yes and part of this was some “red tape” including a personality test and “formal” interview but the energyvibe ive gotten the whole time is that i’m doing well and they are happy to have me here i also told the individual training me afterwards and congratulated me and reiterated that it’s all just formalities i’m now concerned that i was far too honest on the personality test and can’t stop thinking about the next conversation it will be sometime early next week of 617 unfortunately i’m somebody who has a hard time dealing with anticipation especially with the unknown and i have completely spiraled about this

am i just over thinking and freaking out for no reason

i do live in an at will state so theoretically they could let me go with no issues over anything

i was overtly honest about my selfesteem mental health and being an introvert but the role doesn’t require me to interact with many people besides email and messaging",1

"hello today i drove home from work it is a 15 min drive
when i stopped at the red light in an intersection my car started to act really weird i freaked out and begged for it to work as i restarted it i turned the key but nothing happened this never happened to me before so i immediately started shaking and calling my insurance agent who’s my best friend’s dad thankfully
then i called a service that would tow my car and had no choice but to keep it overnight because most of the garages work 95
during all of this people drive by and ask if i’m okay i tell them that i don’t know and they look at me like this  and drive away
then this car pulls up right behind me and a beautiful woman asks what happened
i tell her and she immediately jumps out of the car to check while she does that the insurance company calls me about the towing process and the woman on the phone sounds very annoyed both of the women ask me questions and obviously i try to help both while remaining calm and the woman on the phone just can’t deal with it says “hello” every couple of seconds when she clearly hears me talk to the other woman anyway eventually this woman who pulled up behind me got cables and attached it to both cars while we waited some people who were passing by were very annoyed that we blocked a whole lane even though there are 2 lanes going the same direction turning left some passed by and shouted at me pointing and gesturing something like “wtf” and stuff like that one religious woman i live in israel so it’s the ones that wear long sleeves and skirts shouted at me clearly very annoyed to “place a warning triangle” sure i understand that it’s important to notify other drivers of course but in this situation first time something like this happening me stressing heavily i forgot i think screaming that at me is a little evil i was struggling and her tone of voice showed that she wasn’t trying to be helpful 
basically i thank the woman who saved me today but i can’t stop feeling this awful stress because of when those people who passed me by and yelled at me i understand the frustration but you would’ve waited 2 more minutes in crossing to the other lane and kept going wherever you were headed not a big deal somehow i can’t imagine myself being in their shoes and yelling at someone who got stuck and needs help
oh and thankfully i got home but the car won’t start anymore xd
thank you for reading i hope you will meet a helping person when in need ❤️",1
"how do you cope with overwhelm  i am really going through it and trying to be present positive and patient as this tricky season of healing begins but i think one of the root causes of my anxiety and depression is a constant feeling of overwhelming flight or fight being present and patient means having to feel ugly shameful or panic inducing conversations with myself and then the spiral begins and the intrusive rumination begins how can i do this difficult work without the spiral part what are some of your coping methods i’m looking for any and all

"guys do you feel like you’re just acting or pretending all the time to please everyone around you for me it’s like if i’m alone at home or on my own and there’s no one around me only then i can be my authentic self 
if someone walks into my room i’ll suddenly be on high alert get hyper vigilant i can’t act normally when in public
idk it’s like a reflex i do that without thinking because growing up i was always walking on eggshells around my parents cause their  behaviour was so unpredictable 
i always had to check if they’re in a good mood before asking for something because they’d lash out at me if not 
it was so exhausting for me as a child 
they always used to call me that i am the most understanding child labelled the good kid who just does whatever they’ve been told to but it was such a burden to me to maintain this image 
so i never used to express any emotion basically i lost myself trying to become someone that they would like 

so now i no longer know how to be when i am alone outside i no longer know how my authentic self would behave like
i feel fucking empty 
i question everything i no longer know what i want or need or my emotions were ever real 

so thanks to my parents cuz i have to suffer and waste the peak years of my life trying to idk fix myself 
yes i resent them writing this out of pure frustration because i want to be compassionate towards myself now 
 i teared down while writing this but i don’t want to be on survival mode all my life and stop myself from doing things that i really want
also they’re still the same and i’m 22f

"normal xanax effects ive been switched from clonazepam 05 mgday to xanax 05 mgday in 2 025 doses morning and night 

i barely ever felt anything with clonazepam except for not clenching my jaw as much while on it but only a few days in xanax has changed everything im calmer my heart rate has gone down significantly was permanently elevated before my overall feelings are more mellowed out and i feel sleepy in the afternoon yesterday i even had a nap in the afternoon but then still had an amazing night of sleep after that 

obviously these are the desired effects and im not complaining but from what i understand this is still a relatively low dosage right is it common to barely react to one type of medication but to have such a strong reaction to another one from the same family i honestly feel like a different person and its a welcome relief but i guess im a bit startled by how sudden it is",1

we saw my boyfriends mom and family a week after she was born we brought her around to her house then she got poorly and we stayed inside more and made the most of the 4 weeks paternity my partner and i had together most of which was in and out of hospitals

when our little girl was 89 weeks old he said his mom wasn’t happy that she had only met her granddaughter once so i messaged on the group chat and said ‘are you free for us to come around on friday for lunch’ and she said yes she held our baby for an hour while we spoke and had lunch 

she then stopped speaking to me completely turns out my boyfriend had been round to his moms and burst into tears about my mood swings and feeling like his feelings came last honestly i never wanted him to feel like that but i have struggled mentally since having our baby and he hasn’t said very nice things to me either so now she doesn’t want to speak to me she asked my boyfriend if she could take our baby for a walk i was reluctant as i haven’t been away from her yet but i agreed to keep the peace my boyfriend opened the door passed our little girl to his mom she started to cry and scream he looked for her dummy and couldn’t find it anywhere his mom said ‘if she isn’t going to settle and you can’t find the dummy i will leave it for today’ him and his mom then made a huge deal of how weird it was that the dummy went missing and why then and she said ‘it’s almost as if someone didn’t want me taking her out’ i had literally got myself mentally prepared all day and i would never ever take her dummy away the day after my boyfriend found it in his car and he said ‘oops must have happened when i was rushing’

i saw him mom at a school fair this week and it was awful she wouldn’t look at me talk to me she gave me a hug but it was so staged and awkward and doesn’t message on the group chat we had since the dummy

i feel so anxious about seeing her as her daughter goes to the same school as my little boy she has made me cry twice calling out my anxiety infront of family and my boyfriend said it can all be fixed if he can sit down with his mom and explain we are working on things and we’re just going through a rough patch

what would you do if you were me am i in the wrong should i leave the group chat should i reach out

"it doesnt feel like just mental health anymore ive been in a certain headspace lately im not in reality currently i spend most of my day daydreaming or dissociated from our societies point of view im whats called mentally ill and i admit i didnt have the luckiest dice roll in that department

however the current headspace i find myself i dont think its purely a product of that it feels more like me falling out of the illusion that there is hope like i feel like this is a perfectly natural response to my hopelessness i feel like the reason i was genuinely happy for so long after starting to change my mental health was because i was blissfully ignorant that i had this blindfold on where i imagined hope and i took it off to see only emptiness

not just because of the unfortunate things that haveare happening in my life but also the state of the world not only the events themselves but bad energy itself 

i keep hearing about the freeze response chemical imbalances maladaptive daydreaming disorder depersonalization trauma and while the people who say this mean well it feels invalidating i know it sounds awful to even say it that i just refuse to get better but i genuinely feel nothing about all if this i honestly am worried that my words may be misinterpreted and ill feel more alone in the way i feel

whats worse is when they ask me the question do you want to get better and i can never answer this question directly the best answer i have is i dont know i hardly want to participate in reality i have no desire to be creative outside of my daydreams and stuff that used to make me excited feels like its gray i hardly felt the motivation to get out of bed this morning but i forced myself to do it because i need to i dont get excited about the idea that i could get better i just feel tired

at age 17 i joined the marine corps to get away from all of that i havent spoken to mother brothers or sister since in 1983 i was sent to beirut i was involved in several firefights including the bombing of the marine barracks which killed 241 marines i spent the next 3 weeks digging them out a leg here arm there a torso whose tattoo is this was that jones this is when i was first diagnosed with post traumatic stress

after i got out of the marines i became a police officer in one of the most violent cities in california ive investigated well in excess of 100 people for murder unknown amount of rapes armed robberies and every kind of crime imaginable ive seen women sell their children to pedophiles for crack cocaine two people shoot themselves splashing bloodbrain matter all over me ive been shot twice and ive been involved in three separate officer involved shootings what i wrote is just the tip of the iceberg here is when my alcoholism started

so i am an alcoholic almost 5 years sober with cpts complex post traumatic stress it is not a disorder depressionanxiety i take 5 separate medications for all of it i see a psychiatrist once a month and a therapist twice a week however all of the trauma cost me two marriages and one fiancé a helluva a lot of other things too including almost my career i did however retire 5 years ago

so i sit alone in a nice house day in and day out bored out of my mind and very lonely before people start this idaho falls idaho which is about 80 mormon if you arent one of them you are out of luck with making friends andor dating the only social interaction i get is at the gym i have no friends no family and only a cat yes i have tried and tried i get no where my issues and problems always come out and ruin relationships and friendships my two true friends one lives 12 hours away and the other in another country

i see my life as not getting better and i constantly ask why i should live there isnt anything for me on this earth im an atheist as i said no family no kids no anything when it comes down to it if i died no one would care or even know

i guess my point is i can understand why some people feel hopeless unlovable and no need to exist anymore no amount of medication cbtdbt therapy rem etc can change this again in some people not all i just think giving all the positive comments all the time doesntwont work in some people in fact i think it makes matters worse when you are in that dark place and someone tells you to talk to someone or call a hotline it really isnt helping 

we are all different and things affect us differently for you your pastpresent you may overcome some people just dont make it to that point

"what are some songs that you think represent your anxietydepression to a t 24m here for me it’s been take me home by phil collins it’s about a man trapped in a mental asylum talking about the thoughts he has and accepting his fate one part really gets me

“seems so long ive been waiting
still dont know what for
theres no point in escaping
i dont worry anymore
i cant come out to find you
i dont like to go outside
they can turn off my feelings
like theyre turning off the light”

honest to god it really hits me hard growing up i was constantly told to “man up” “stop thinking about it” “don’t be sad you have such a good life” and the like parents and family while they try still don’t understand or get me

"i’m anxious because i get anxious 
so i’ve noticed a pattern my anxiety is usually like this 

i feel anxious about something i get angry and easily irritated i get better and feel guilt because i got easily irritated and probably offended someone the guilt turns into anxiety i get anxious because i got anxious 

so after being anxious i get ‘better’ and realise i wasn’t supposed to act like this and get guilty and then i feel anxious about getting anxious and think i’m not supposed to live like this every day and that i’m not normal and must have lots of disorders health anxiety diagnosed…

it’s a vicious circle i get anxious because i get anxious i don’t know if it makes sense guilt makes me anxious

anyone with some insight

"anxious when asking for needs or wants i have so much guilt and fear whenever i ask for what i want especially from my romantic partner i will defer to their needs over mine and then resent them when i insisted that it be that way

it sucks that i can see why my anxiety acts like this but not knowing how to manage it i’m medicated which has helped immensely and in therapy but i’m still often overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety that someone will be mad or resentful if i ask for things i prefer or need

"medication is not a cure hi all

i hope everyone is doing well so long story short i am an inspiring journalist in 2018 i started to have anxiety and it affected every aspect of my life my trigger was watching a true crime show and since then that has been my trigger and it intensifies all the issues i have been having 

this year i started having anxiety again due to my trigger and being a graduate student to be honest it was worse than usual also a part of that is due to the fact that i was taking adhd medication that did help my attention span but increased my anxiety 

however in march i started taking lexapro after being diagnosed with gad which was life changing i mean more than life changing and i felt amazing also i started to see a new therapist but my doctor then stopped me from taking lexapro because i started to gain a lot of weight im already plus size so my doctor didnt want to risk it so she switched me to prozac i have been still feeling great and seeing my therapist 

but at times i still feel anxious like today i have been anxious for a few hours but i will say its not as severe as it usually is on monday i was triggered again by something i had seen in relation to true crime i am still embarrassed to say it at times but as i have learned i am human and i have secondary ptsd also my therapist helped me reach a breaking point that i never realized in my life i just feel there is more to come which i am very open about 

but i want to know if you feel better taking anxiety medication but still at times have days when you feel anxious like i said it has been life changing but i want to make sure i am not the only one who still has days when i feel anxious and on edge ",1

"extremely anxious about dentist visit tomorrow and the epinephrine in the needle  hey everyone 

its been about 7 years since ive last been to the dentist after i was too old for my fathers health insurance and the fact that its very expensive i had to stop going then covid happened and it worsened my anxiety i was diagnosed with agoraphobia but luckily things have been better since 

  
ive had this grey spot on my tooth for the last 23 years now and some pain that comes and goes although no pain when chewing a week ago today i was using my flossing waterpik and i noticed lots of pressure in that tooth with the grey spot the pain was almost unbearable for two days and has gradually lessened as the days go by there is mainly just on and off sensitivity from heatcold and some slight throbbing last night the pain was terrible but thankfully i used some hydrogen peroxide mouth wash and took an advil and it went away there is pain in my lower jaw bone and last week i had pain in the ear on the same side of the tooth right but the ear pain has been very on and off 

  
tomorrow is my appointment to the dentist and after reading such bad scary stories on reddit im so worried about the local anesthesia and the fact that the needle has epinephrine i didnt realize that is basically like adrenaline and if it gets into your veins it can cause bad panic attack symptoms i really dont think i want to deal with that 

so the needle has gotten me very worked up as i know my tooth probably has a deep cavity and it will need to get fixed let me add in that prior to my knowledge on the adrenaline in the local anesthesia needle i never was nervous or worried about it i always had cavities growing up and never had a side effect to it but after finding that information out i am now terrified and i keep crying thinking about tomorrow ",1

does anyone have a panic attack anytime their throat feels a little weird ive had pretty bad anxiety the past few years at first it was heart rate anxiety heart rate being too high went to the er and it was in the 190s i wont get into it but that whole thing was traumatizing anyways turns out my heart is fine and it was anxiety so now i have my heart rate under control so i think i completely got over it and i hardly ever panic about it now well now anytime my throat feels a little tight or a little itchy it pretty much always sends me into a panic attack i always fear of anaphylaxis or asthma attack i dont have asthma and the only thing ive ever been known to be allergic to is penicillin but i am convinced it is happening even though i know its not but i cant just not panic about it has anyone experienced anything like this ,1
"i did it and you can too revisiting this community after getting a handle on my anxiety ive noticed in many subs that deal with afflictions or disorders once people reach resolution they often stop posting updates and get on with their lives perhaps creating a bit of a discouraging but luckily false bias that we are doomed to battling anxiety forever

so tldr i just wanted to lend some encouragement to everyone struggling today that it got better for me and that you will get better too once you find an approach towards healing that works for you you will get back to or achieve a fulfilling life you are proud of keep pushing because you are deserving of that life



i frequented this sub a couple years ago because after a lifetime of a passing bad mood being the worst mental thing to happen to me crippling anxiety hit me like a semi truck rounding a blind corner in my late twenties many compounding variables might have precipitated this rather than a traumatic event but nonetheless i was down so bad

i had horrible visceral physical panic attacks seemingly at random multiple times a day i went to the er because of this twice because i thought i was dying i had intense dissociation events when i wasnt having panic attacks where i didnt even feel like i was existing in this world when i got a handle on the physical symptoms side of things i had a period of having debilitating thought spirals and cyclical thought patterns that rendered me almost as useless as the panic attacks did 

  
however happy to say today that though mental lows are a part of life i have a much firmer grasp on my mental health after 2 years of anxiety kicking the shit out of me

i honestly dont feel qualified to give advice but here is what worked for me and hopefully at least something can work for you too these arent necessarily long term phycological solutions but they are what pulled me out of the depths and have allowed me to continue on to do further work on my mental landscape

 if you are having trouble meeting your basic needs mental or physical seek professional help
 keep your body moving in my experience it is much more difficult though not impossible lol to have a panic attack if you are moving go on a walk stretch do a manageable chore like sweeping etc preemptively if you are feeling something coming on
 dont skip meals even if anxiety is making you feel nauseous
 exercise can be whatever active looks like for you main thing here is that you get endorphins going you tucker yourself out so that you cant freak out as hard later and you improve your self image dont let anxiety talk you out of skipping this do any amount you feel capable of
 cool it on the alcohol unfortunately the amplification of anxiety the next day from drinking will set you back 10 paces best to not drink for a while if things are really bad for you
 cool it on the caffeine similar to above i switched to decaf when things were really bad and then worked my way back up
 log off social media it takes some mental strength to do this but social media is another anxiety amplifier when you are not mentally well it literally is better to spend your free time staring at the ceiling rather than scrolling level one is stopping the anxiety increase level two is learning to sit with yourself again and getting invested in your own life
 dont isolate if youre extroverted dont forgo your normal socialization patterns if youre embarrassed go to the bathroom and have a panic attack in private and then get back out there like nothing happened if youre introverted try to be around someone you trust semifrequently interacting with others forces you out of your own brain and into reality when you need to get a grip rather than continuing to be stuck in your own often irrational perspective
 keep your brain active on something useful drawpaintwriteetch a sketch make cornhusk dolls really doesnt matter even if youre bad at it force yourself to read about what you used to be interested in look at art call your mom be inspired again it takes self discipline to rip yourself out of a thought cycle and it will be hard at first but theres no end solution to an anxiety cycle because its not rational so you have to break the cycle or prevent it from happening doing something to preoccupy your brain in a non selfcannibalizing way is key
  presentness elusive and what i rolled my eyes at most when i was in the trenches but its unfortunately as good as what they say appraise and exist in the current moment dont get started on the what if statements you are in charge of the decision you make next from as small as if you continue sitting or stand up all the way to as large as if you quit your job and move towns sorry to get woo woo on this last point but dont let this existence thing we all have go to waste 

  
good luck out there on the battlefield and i hope this post can be a beacon toward better days that are coming to you dont forget youre the hbic in your life not your anxiety it gets better",1

i’m 30f and have never been in a relationship the goal has always been to find a long term relationship with someone special however the thought of dating has always made me want to throw up and hide under a blanket a few years ago i tried online dating for the first time with the help of a therapist whilst it was a great way to get dating experience i found myself completely burnt out and overwhelmed even just after one date i felt like i needed a few months to rest and build the strength to go on another date it would make me feel sad that i couldn’t feel comfortable or even get a little enjoyment from hanging out with someone new

on top of that i find it hard to talk to my friends about this because they all have been in relationships and have been dating since their teens it makes me realise that my situation is odd and unusual which can definitely feel isolating

"feeling a little bad about a rude response from my manager at work about my sickness more details below hi everyone for some context i got my first job about a year ago and work weekends during my college semester and for this summer i work part time 

around april i had the flu and had to call out and towards the start of june i switched a shift with my coworker took one of her shifts and she took mine because my family from turkey was visiting so i wanted to spend some time with them and then 34 days before a religious holiday eid i took off for eid as my local mosque announced the date of the holiday a little late

and then suddenly this morning i got a high fever that caused me to not be able to walk properly and stay in bed all day and as i have work tomorrow i texted my manager and she responded with this 

it made me a little upset because she wasn’t at all empathetic about the fact that i’m ill right now and only pointed out the fact that i changed my schedule a “few times”  1 of which was for eid a religious holiday the other spending time with family of which i made up the hours for because i switched shifts with my coworker and now i suddenly got sick and somehow it’s my fault for potentially not being able to come in i cannot control if i get sick or not

"health anxietyfear of blood clots and getting back on bc 


hello i am a 20yearold female and about 4 years ago i developed  health anxiety which i have been struggling with ever since i dont know what to do anymore every day i worry about a new disease i might have i constantly check my neck to see if i can feel any lumps i always want to go for tests at the doctors but on the other hand i am afraid of the results

the worst thing for me is the fear of blood clots not a day goes by when i wake up without thinking about them last year i took diane 35 for acne and i cried every day at the thought of getting a blood clot which  i always feel could spread to my lungs or brain this year i stopped taking the pills and took a break as advised by my doctor i did a coagulation test which came back good all values were normal but i still have this indescribable fear of blood clots

while i was on the pills i occasionally smoked in social settings about 5 cigarettes a week and only later did i read the instructions and realized that it was dangerous to smoke while on diane 35 despite the good coagulation test results afterwards i still fear that i will develop a blood clot now i only smoke on weekends when i go out

this year i am going back on diane 35 because my acne has worsened and i am afraid i will have panic attacks at the thought of blood clots on the other hand my acne is so bad that i cannot look at myself in the mirror do you have any advice on how to reduce my fear of blood clots

"constant panic attacks at night drug related as the title suggests there are drugs related to this post if you arent comfortable please stop reading as i dont wanna trigger anyone on accident

a bit of backstory my friend gave me an cannabis edible to try and i triggered a panic attack when i was high it was my first time doing it and i was all alone in my room so i was shit scared and i didnt know what to do i probably consumed around 45mg or more since i didnt know proper dosage ever since that experience my curiosity regarding cannabis as completely diminished and i got rid of whatever that was leftover of the edibles

its been a month since then and i have a racing heartbeat whenever im in my room at night sometimes it can trigger in the morning the rain as well as wind noise the noise wind makes when hitting a window can be a trigger to just extreme fear and paranoia although ive been slowly getting better overtime i need advice catered to what im currently experiencing since as per a suggestion from a yt video i watched i shouldnt really research on the topic to avoid scaring myself even more

ive noticed that i get extremely paranoid over little things regarding my health eg i had a panic attack when my forearm started to hurt which i the found out was because i was carrying really heavy groceries i get extremely paranoid whenever i hear my heartbeat too although im not exactly sure why being alone could also trigger this sometimes i noticed my symptoms getting worse when i dont have someone to talk to or when theres no one around my guess is that its because i have my thoughts and my thoughts only and i dont really have anything to distract myself from it

although i am starting to slowly get better and i can confidently say that it wasnt as bad when it first started i cant exactly say that im completely over it it still controls my life and unfortunately the only way to get rid of this is to stop thinking about it completely which unfortunately i cant do

currently im looking for ways to calm my heartbeat down or try and calm the panic i may expirence my friend said to completely avoid the place where i had the bad experience at but unfortunately i did it in my room so theres no avoiding that please if anyone has a similar experience to mine and could give me some advice regarding this ill greatly appreciate it since i feel really lost as of right now

none of the antidepressants have ever worked for me although i’ll still try wellbutrin

i will be trying ketamine therapy soon

"why does my brain always work against me i i feel like that it wants me to suffer and it loves to give me tons of anxiety

 like whenever i play a game my mind will tell me that i’ll become so obsessed with it that i’ll go crazy and have seizures if i can’t play it i’m not even that addicted 

same goes for watching anime when i like a character my brain will tell me that i’ll be so in love with them that i wish they were real and i will go crazy because they don’t exist 

same goes for kpop i’ll like a kpop idol and my brain will tell me i’ll be so obsessed with them that i’ll be a crazy fan and eventually went nuts

 what’s worse is that when i’m driving and see a passer by my brain will tell me that i want to know everything about that person and i want to meet them again etc

 once when i was watching a horror movie my brain would tell me that i’ll have a heart attack even though i have no health problems 

and when i read the news for example a unalived b because a is angry at b since b doesn’t give money that they owed to a and then my brain will start to analyze my situation and be like “hey that one person owe you money maybe you should do the same” and i would have panic attacks

struggling with depression and considering anti depressants although i don’t really want to rely on that stuff and i think there are other things i can do first such as exercise eating better sleeping better and keeping apartment tidy  
  
depression thoughts for me are  
  
• i am 38 lots of years wasted in bad jobs and bad relationships  
  
• feel like i wasted too much time and should have sorted myself out 20 years earlier  
  
• might never get a meaningful relationship such as wife and kids  
  
• can’t decide if i even want to have a wife and kids  
  
• can’t decide what i want with my life and when i do decide i just change my mind  
  
• sometimes think i just want to travel party and have fun but other times think that is a pointless and meaningless existence  
  
• maybe anti depressants could fix this but they could also act as a distraction or be a source of worry for me  
  
• noise and aggression from neighbours is unpleasant  
  
i thought i’d through this out into the internet ether to see if anyone can relate sometimes its amazing how people share such similar stories

"anxiety attacks and depression is making them worse  not sure where to turn to 

i dont post stuff like this on here but this is the only place i can find where i can get this out

ive been struggling a lot lately between stress medical issues anxiety attacks panic attacks nightmares its all been adding up and i didnt really realize that till this morning last night me and a friend couldnt sleep so we ended up on a call just screwing around catching up talking just being happy and having fun like we used to years ago like asking random questions talking about life talking about the past and plans for the future making fun of exs and just enjoying his company and i woke up this morning with a smile on my face i woke up to my alarm instead of a nightmare throwing me into a panic attack its sad that it took me waking up perfect this morning to realize just how bad ive gotten and now that ive noticed it i feel like its getting worse i have maybe 2 friends and im not even sure of that anymore im pretty sure one just blocked me and the other has read all of my stuff without replying for a week now so i might have none wich me and j talked a little bit about last night just a bit and i think were friends i think hes my only friend it really fucking sucks cuz i think i still love him but im scared to love again my last ex left me pregnant with twins and horrified and when i messaged his family to let him know i lost them he laughed at me like jee fucking thanks i didnt want to have sex in the first place then you block me instead of facing what you forced me to deal with i dont think j would do that but at the same time im scared of everyone and everything at this point ive gotten pretty good at hidding it and coping with it better but im still scared and if i thinm about it too much ill have a panic attack but im getting off topic i woke up this morning after the call last night super happy and had a great day and i couldnt stop smiling just replaying our conversations from last night in my head but the closer its getting to nighttime watching the sun go down and leaving my room in the dark im realizing thats probably a one and done we barely text let alone call guess it just woke up that needy bitch that would beg for a call beg to hear there voice just because i find it calming i used to be able to call him durring a panic attack and id be calm in a few minutes i messaged a couple times today just stupid shit and he read it but didnt reply so part of me is destroying myself over it like i know with work and family and friends like sometimes youll read a message and forget about it i know i do that sometimes and im trying to keep that in mind but when your completely alone its hard and i cant make myself message him more then once i messaged earlier and now i cant make myself till he replys i tried to again a little bit ago but it made me have a pretty severe panic attack i hate bothering people but itd getting out of hand ",1

"morning and event dont seem like the same day  daily dissociation  this community seems like the most adequate to consult this matter

an issue that occurs quite often as part of my anxiety is a feeling that the morning and my time at work seem like a completely different day than the afternoon or the evening sometimes i feel like i wake up a few times per day and feel like one day is two or more separate days is there a scientific term to describe this im trying to find solutions but also answers to why this is happening and how i can confront it maybe your similar experiences can help me too

after years of dealing with anxiety and consulting this matter with my psychologist and psychiatrist i still dont know why im experiencing this especially that this feeling is accompanied by an inability to focus my vision extremely dry eyes and a stuporlike feeling something between dissociation and derealisation sometimes its so strong that i feel like ive been hypnotised

the worst part is that this happens almost every day other symptoms that ive always been worried about the psychosomatic ones are annoying but at least ive understood why they occur i cant cope with this dissociationlike feeling its too weird lastly despite a few years of experiencing this i still dont know if the abovementioned are symptoms of the general anxiety or an effect of other symptoms occuring",1

"anxiety is stoppable  
it’s time to beatreduce your anxiety for good this is a perfect way to do so and you’re not going to like it at first but first we need to accept some things and understand some things about anxiety 

1 understand that those physical symptoms and mental symptoms you are feeling is only anxiety that head pressure ear ringing tingling“hurting” chest the arm pains the finger feet and hand tingling the “blurry vision” the muscle twitches the palpitations the skipped beats the memory loss or brain fog the dizziness nausea butterflies unsure feelings etc the list goes on its anxiety 

2 anxiety’s rating of 110 1 being low 10 being extreme is majority determined by our reaction  

3 anxiety is only adrenaline and worry mixed when it’s not needed therefore it’s sitting idle in your head with no reason or way to exert itself that’s why you get all these physical symptoms

4 anxiety can’t kill you

5 100 recovery is possible 

you have got to accept your anxiety stop trying to hide from it or make it stop with your tactics sit with it accept it be uncomfortable and let the thoughts flow yes it’s absolutely horrible at first but the more you sit with it and let it eat you up the more your brain starts realizing that there was no threat or bad outcome and that you turned out fine so over time it becomes the norm and doesn’t faze you all the way to the point of it not existing when those attacks happen say out loud “i accept this anxiety” “do whatever it is you are going to do anxiety” this has brought me to a 999 recovery i had horrible health anxiety that then made me fear death i went to therapy it helped i took wellbutrin it helped but they never cured me only numbed it kinda i started studying every side of anxiety and all of its characteristics and i learned that it’s only fear we have to overcome and be comfortable with

i didn’t worry until friday when i didn’t get my period i have been having some health issues like really really bad gerd and indigestion it has taken over my life and it’s messed up my diet and life now since not getting my period all i can think about is getting my period and thinking about every little thing that my body is doing like if i get a cramp in my lower stomach or if i feel something down there i am just obsessing about it 

the last 3 days i have just felt sort of dizzy and have had a headache in the top of my forehead and just overall like kind of feeling dissociated i can’t tell if it’s because of anxiety or a symptom of pregnancy 
on top of that i have had minor cramps since mid last week i just can’t stop obsessing over the fact that i could be pregnant and every single symptom i am having i do have a sensitive stomach so in my mind i’m like if i was pregnant wouldn’t i be throwing up and stuff i can’t think of any reason on why my period is late besides pregnancy like if it was stress wouldn’t i have had to been stressed out like way earlier in my cycle idk someone just please give me your input or advice or something i am desperate i am gonna try and take a pregnancy test tomorrow so hopefully it will ease my mind 
edit also this has happened before the first week of school my period was late and i took a test and it was negative then i got my period after a couple of days 
the reason this is scaring me worse than other times is because my breasts are sore i’m having cramps and other symptoms like shouldn’t i have gotten it by now

along with that i realized it actually isn’t normal to genuinely want to kys everyday i lay down to go to sleep and i think every single time “i can’t do it anymore i’m so exhausted it never gets better” every single day i have to battle the thoughts of just ending it all i don’t know what’s more frustrating these thoughts or the fact i know full heartedly that i am human and death is final and i haven’t really pressed that yet and the thought of what’s after scares me i’m too pussy basically 

“erm go to therapy” stop pleaseee i went to therapy for a very long time but my circumstances growing up have made it very difficult to open up and actually talk about it also i have a profound self awareness but lack the motivation to actually make a difference i think i just don’t believe i will ever be happy and honestly i am on medication and i don’t take it i took it for awhile but it just made everything worse and quite frankly i’m embarrassed of the person i am i hate myself and who i’ve become the guilt from the people i’ve hurt plagues me everyday telling that to another person i have enough judgment on my own

the reason i’m writing this post is because i hit a dead end i don’t feel fulfilled by anything anymore i know that any happiness i feel will easily deplete and i’ll go back to hurt i’m going away to college soon and i’m scared of the time i’ll have alone with my thoughts i’m scared i won’t be able to let go and it will all follow is it time i reach out for help",1

can anxiety create breathing issues hey i’m trying not to freak myself out but since yesterday i’ve had this weird sensation when breathing like i’d breathe in and take a pause before doing it properly it kept me from sleeping for a while last night i don’t have any chronic conditions i know of and i live a pretty sentimentary lifestyle i barely walk due to fears so i’m not sure if that’s contributing ,1
if i knew nobody would me mad at me i would kill myself right now i am so dissociated from reality and it makes it extremely hard to wake up or even open my eyes i spend all day in my bed with my eyes closed dreaming about a different reality and  every time i have to open my eyes to eat i want to die i hate myself because my grandma is sick and i havent done shit to help because im so dissociated that i cant even process her sickness i feel a heavy burning sensation in my chest and throat all the time and it makes me want to scream and cry and throw shit and just  throw a complete tantrum but even if i did i still dont know if it would help i miss my ex even though he treated me like shit and hes a leech because he also treated me really well and i constantly feel like im being pulled every which way and i dont know what to do i hate the relationship i have with my mom because its strained and not getting better because neither of us are healed and im trying to heal but i dont know how or have the motivation or belive it will stick because ill just argue with her again i wish nobody ever met me and i just didnt exist i wish i could sleep forever,1

"scientists refer to the spiritual energy emitted by human beings as electromagnetic biomagnetic and as bioelectromagnetic fields   


  
according to the experience of those who can feel and control their bioelectricity for healing or other purposes it can be best explained as a type of energy very much like electricity which flows through the body  


  
in the eastern part of the world its called qi and is known there as the chemical processes in biological organisms that involve charged potentials and thus the flow of electric current  


  
this electric current then produces corresponding magnetic fields inside and around the human body  


  
it flows through the body via channels or meridians that connect all parts of the body and it can be easily activated and amplified through very specific breathing techniques  


  
it is that which differentiates life from death inanimate from animate to live is to have this bioelectricity in every part of your body to die is to be a body without it  


  
this spiritual energy can be most easily felt within us through selfinduced goosebumps from positive eventsstimuli eventually you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps everywhere you want and for the duration you desire  


  
 it has been researched and documented under many names like bioelectricity life force prana chi qi orgone rapture tension aura euphoria ecstasy mana vayus asmr nen intent tummo odic force kriyas pitī frisson ruah spiritual energy secret fire the tingles ondemand quickening voluntary piloerection aether chills spiritual chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help   
 

  
here are three written tutorials going more indepth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from  


  
ps everyone feels it at certain points in their life some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on those are exactly the people you can find on rspiritualchills where they share experiences knowledge and tips on it",1

"is this anxiety perspectives and ideas gratefully received just a bit of context i 36f live with my partner 36m daughter 11 and son 3 months i’m struggling a bit at the moment as i think everyone with a new baby does to some extent

i’m fairly sure i have some anxiety but it manifests itself most when i’m about to leave the house i’m just not sure what to call this though as i don’t think it’s social anxiety  i don’t try ink i worry about socialising and i’m not afraid of being out of the house at all  i like going out it’s the specific act of leaving the house that has me anxious sometimes i’m afraid to be late but even when we are going for a walk or something that i can’t really be late for i get anxious and stressed at rounding everyone up to leave and i usually upset my family i am aware of this but even when i try to conceal my stress it is still very obvious to my family
i’m trying to understand exactly what makes me anxious in this situation but struggling to identify the issue

something i have thought of is that my dad who i’m also fairly sure has anxiety used to get pretty anxious from what i remember about leaving the house he would never want to be late and i think that when i was a child perhaps leaving the house was quite stressful though i don’t recall being particularly upset by it as a childi’m not trying to blame him i guess just wondering if that could have contributed 
i feel horrible that i’m doing the same and upsetting my children i desperately want to stop and understand what is wrong but i’m so confused by it
i think i also have other areas of anxiety and worry quite a lot about upsetting my family annoying them in the process

i’m having a very low day today and feel so useless any advise would be so gratefully received i’m not sure how well i’ve explained it all",1

"dealing with feeling like people dont take you seriously or think youre crazy my anxiety has gotten to a point where its basically my default at all times and im starting to feel like those who are around me think im crazy or that they dont take me seriously when i feel like something is wrong with me

a great example is from a few weeks ago i was just relaxing at home when suddenly i felt like my throat was closing up i could still breathe and talk but my anxiety immediately sent me into a panic making me think i was going to die i called my mother like i usually do when dealing with severe anxiety and explained to her what was going on and she didnt seem concerned or anything and all she said was i think its just anxiety

the whole i think its just anxiety thing really gets to me it really makes me feel like im not being taken seriously in my mind i thought i was dying but here is my mother just being really casual and unconcerned at all this feeling got even worse once i figured out that it was actually my gerd causing globus sensation which had never happened before so it wasnt anxiety at all this in and of itself contributes to my general anxiety now as well thinking that one time something really is going to be wrong with me but itll be chalked up as anxiety and ill end up suffering or even dying because of it

on another note i constantly feel like people think im crazy or unreasonable ive been prescribed bupropion xl 150mg for depression and adhd once a day in the morning along with clonazepam for anxiety once a day or as needed that i have yet to take i have severe health anxiety and severe anxiety surrounding medication due to something that happened in my childhood my aunt was prescribed strattera back when it was newer took one pill and died the next morning it was caused by a combination of her recently taking an mao and her having some kind of tumors though i cant remember exactly what tumors and where

im a very analytical person and generally rely on logic and reasoning but my anxiety inherently rejects logic and reasoning i know that what happened to my aunt will most likely not happen to me i dont have the tumors she had i have never taken an mao but my anxiety doesnt care my anxiety rejects any kind of reassurance that if i take these medications that ill most likely be fine and that they may even help

i try to explain this to people and they think im crazy ill equate it to the hypothetical situation of walking down the street with your friend as a kid when suddenly your friend gets attacked by a dog yes it didnt happen directly to you but you witnessed it happen to your friend so you very well may develop a fear or phobia of dogs ive explained this to a few people and while some agree others dont noting that they are two completely different scenarios

one time i burned my throat on hot food and it sent me into a panic attack thinking my throat was going to swell up and i was going to die my mother kept telling me think logically but thats not exactly how it works i have a very difficult time using logic or reasoning to get myself out of a thought or mood that i didnt logically or reasonably get myself into

i guess its just frustrating and makes me feel worse and contributes to my anxiety feeling like people see me as crazy or like the boy who cried wolf it also doesnt help that i live in a town where anxiety and depression is still met with sentiments like just get over it and be a man

apologies for the long post but i guess my question here is does anyone else feel that same way and if you do how exactly do you deal with it am i crazy for having a hard time taking the medications im supposed to",1
afraid to sleep about four days ago i got sick with fever but i got over it pretty quickly since then whenever i try to go to sleep at night my mind gets filled with these random thoughts that make no sense incessantly thoughts equivalent to a dream in the sense they mean nothing and are not based on reality i also wake up very confused and already filled with utter anxiety for no reason i think it could be confusion arousal but i’m not educated on it really i’ve been back and forth to restroom in the mornings nonstop as well my stomach is haywire when i try meditation exercises i feel my stomach sinking or my chest has a weird twinge that makes me shocked out of it with fear or just another weird feeling it’s affecting my sleep so terribly and i feel like i’m going crazy if anybody has any idea what this could be please help me out this happened once before when i went to europe last summer and it was horrible and i don’t understand why it would come back i do have general anxiety disorder but i just don’t know how this comes back anxiety ,1

2  i fast regularly from 7pm till around 5pm most days with some exceptions for family i have lived like this a long 6 months and do i feel amazing 

3 i regularly take nootropics and mct oil in my coffe for energy and for cognitive benefits as well as all the other benefits 

4 i have not had a single snack or food item between meals that was something i started early this year i still still not eaten any refined sugar  i have no zero chance of desiring those at present my mind simply doesnt even think about these or crave these anymore 

5 i have finally got back into studying after long period of procrastinating and i am hoping to really complete my degree  next year 

6 i have been doing very long exercise regime since january i walking 10k every day or more i also regularly visit the gym and hiit workouts and strength training

10 i am gonna change the narrative in my mind when i do apply for roles so they they do not judge me and make assumptions i cant cope with stuff when i can think of living with a condition as personal experience to move learn and grow rather get me out of this situation and instead have opinion i have been through that challenge i can understand from service users point of view in their shoes ",1
"i can’t function anymore as the title suggests it’s almost to a point where i 25m can’t function the anxiety is new to me and mostly situational passenger anxiety i got out of a relationship 8 months ago where i was physically assaulted in a car and my ex drove 130 mph while threatening to end us both now when i even get into a vehicle it feels like my heart like is going to explode im going to faint i shake violently and my chest gets so tight to the point of it becoming nearly impossible to breathe i know therapy is an option but it’s so impossible to even be in a vehicle right now that it’s not even on the table i’ve tried to ease into it practicing small drives around parking lots etc and it just doesn’t help at all my new partner has been very supportive and understanding but i feel bad because it’s preventing me from being able to go do things with her 

the worst part is i never had anxiety attacks or panic attacks before this in my entire life but now even stepping outside on a balcony or taking out the trash or even breathing a certain way does it 

i just started taking 20mg propranolol i’ve been taking 10mg doses twice daily splitting the pill in half and although it does help the physical symptoms of my anxiety quite a bit it doesn’t do anything for the mental aspect i try putting water on my face carrying an ice pack for my neck and face breathing exercises make it worse talking and conversation make it worse and distracting myself on my phone makes it worse i had to sit in a walmart parking lot in the passenger seat for 2 hours because i couldn’t fathom or handle an 8 minute drive back home it doesn’t matter who’s vehicle im in who im with etc because mentally i know im safe i know im not in danger and it has nothing to do with how the person is driving but because the attacks have gotten so bad i cannot hop into a vehicle or even think about it without associating it with panic i’ve never even been in a wreck  i’ve tried the dare method as well i really feel stuck and i feel like i’m on my last limb here with anxiety  there doesn’t seem to be anything i can do to make it better but it’s ruining my life i would be so grateful for absolutely any advice im tired of the feeling of dread like im being hunted or like my life is in danger for absolutely no logical reason ",1

"finding courage in change a journey of growth and opportunity  change is a constant in life yet for many of us it’s a daunting prospect that pushes us out of our comfort zones and into the unknown my journey is a testament to the transformative power of change as i navigated the ups and downs of stepping into unfamiliar territory finding my voice and embracing new opportunities

growing up i was always the quiet one hesitant to speak up and afraid that my opinions didn’t hold value compared to others’ this fear followed me into the working world where i struggled with anxiety and selfdoubt as i searched for my place it wasn’t until i found myself in a kitchen environment that things began to change

cooking has always been my passion and working in a kitchen allowed me to express myself in ways i never thought possible

despite facing challenges from colleagues who underestimated me due to my appearance and perceived abilities i pushed forward proving my worth with hard work attention to detail and a genuine love for what i do

over time i rose through the ranks gaining confidence and recognition for my skills yet when presented with the opportunity to explore new horizons i hesitated the prospect of leaving my comfort zone was terrifying but deep down i knew it was necessary for my growth

i took a leap of faith and ventured into new environments from a small bistro to one of ontario’s largest golf courses each experience brought its own set of challenges and rewards from navigating complex kitchen equipment to learning from worldclass chefs despite the initial nerves and uncertainties i thrived in these new environments expanding my skills and broadening my perspective

however when my old boss offered me a chance to return to familiar grounds i found myself torn the allure of comfort and familiarity was strong but deep down i knew i craved more it was a tough decision but ultimately i chose to embrace change once again knowing that it was the key to unlocking my full potential

now as i prepare to embark on a new chapter at cafe 13 i’m filled with a mix of excitement and nerves the thought of starting over with unfamiliar faces is daunting but i remind myself of the growth and opportunities that lie ahead

for those facing similar crossroads my advice is simple embrace change with an open mind and a courageous heart it may be scary at first but stepping out of your comfort zone is where true growth happens surround yourself with supportive individuals who believe in your abilities and never underestimate the power of perseverance

remember change is not a destination but a journey and each step forward opens doors to new possibilities so take that leap of faith and who knows you may just soar to heights you never thought possible",1

"can i please get some reassurance it all started when i had a random cold my mom suggested i started using flonase so i did and that was fine then a benadryl a few days later got majorly dizzy and wasn’t sure about taking that it was then that i went to the doctor turned out i had some buildup in my ears it was then i was given prednisone that was the moment everything went downhill

i took only one the day i got them late at night and my heart started to feel like it was beating out of my chest like it was gonna explode or something we went to the er they did tests to make sure i was ok and it turns out it was apparently “just a panic attack” they prescribed me xanax and sent me home i didn’t really believe it was a panic attack at first but everyone else just kept insisting that it was i have no idea anymore but it’s the most likely solution i guess

i didn’t take any more of the prednisone felt like garbage the next few days and only took the xanax whenever i really needed it since my mom said it was highly addictive my anxiety has never been higher and it’s opened my eyes that i’ve been hurting myself and listening to the badness for years now i’m trying to make a change

i’ve been going on nice 30 minute walks eating a little healthier than i normally do and have been attempting to get better sleep i even took up meditation for a bit on a vr game called maloka but even though i’ve made good progress things somehow keep getting worse

i went back to the doctor’s turns out everything in my body was ok and i was prescribed hydroxyzine i’ve been told and have read that it’s a better version of xanax so i’ve been taking it daily as needed recently though i’ve started noticing i’ve been feeling randomly nauseous and dizzy in fact i have been even before the hydroxyzine i have also read that apparently hydroxyzine can cause weird heart stuff and even though i believe it only really occurs in older people and i’m 19 i think i would’ve been fine

i’ve been taking low doses now for a bit just to see if things get better but they really haven’t i don’t know if it’s just anxiety itself a lack of eating as much as i used to a psychological withdrawal from the hydroxyzine or something else i wake up only slightly dizzy every morning feel dizzy throughout the day and go to bed dizzy i don’t know what’s going on i’m so mad that the moment i try to better myself for my own good things go wrong i’m terrified on what might happen if i don’t get advice from someone so i guess my general question is what should i do is this normal is anyone else out there familiar with what i’m going through and does itcan it get better please i feel like i need to know it’s all actually going to be ok i’m so scared

"just want to get it off my chest  a rant by me this isnt a biggie  for anyone other than me that is but i just want to get it off my chest 

basically i purchased my first home a couple of years ago ive got servere anxiety and all i ever really wanted was somewhere permanent of my own i was so happy i was so happy that my anxiety even started to get better after years of torment 

a few years later the house next door was sold to new owners i was excited to meet them  i introduced myself and was always friendly until one day we had a bit of an altercation

to cut a long story short someone doing work on my property accidentally caused some minor damage to a part of their property i was unaware of this until my neighbour a grown man knocked my door and asked me to join him out the back of the houses which i did here he told me about the damage and became very angry i apologised immediately and repeatedly but he kept berating me he told me i was disrespectful again and again i explained that i never intended to cause damage to his property and that i was really sorry i had a panic attack and started crying he then told me that he was going to build something which would prevent me from accessing part of my own land i told him that legally he couldnt do that by this point im crying shaking and apologising which might seem an overreaction but i have an enormous fear of confrontation my parter heard something going on outside and came to see what all the fuss was about he was annoyed to find that i was upset and told our neighbour that he should have asked to speak to him rather than me at this point the neighbour really calmed down  he apologised for upsetting me and said to forget about what he had said and that he was just angry we went inside and that was that for the neighbour anyway

when i got inside the house i has some sort of breakdown i had a lot going on in my life anyway and the house had always been my safe haven and for some reason this interaction sent me over the edge i was having a full panic attack  vomiting shaking and unable to eat for days i was extremely unwell i closed all the curtains and developed a bizarre paranoia i thought that the man next door would set fire to our house or kill us i was in utter torment and this went on for months after months of this i tried to end my life and ended up in hospital

i got some really great help after this and after a long time lots of medication and therapy  i began to feel better im still terrified of our neighbours they arent particularly warm towards us but they arent threatening us in any way either i know that my feelings might seem irrational but that altercation really left a mark on me 

my issue now is that even though over a year has passed  i am miserable in this house all i want to do is move this thought never quite goes away i still avoid the man next door whenever possible and my heart still sinks when i see him outside im no longer happy here and that makes me so deeply sad i never go and sit in the garden due to my fear and whilst i am getting better the curtains are open and i dont vomit when i see them anymore i cant accept what happened 

i cant afford to move right now but i feel like my life is on hold until i do i never really enjoy myself because all of my thoughts revolve around how i will save enough to move and when will i be able to 

anyway no one really needed to know any of that and im not expecting any advice from this i just needed to get it out there thanks",1

ive been to multiple doctors and psychiatrist my mental health seems to be fine and nearly all my results are within a normal range the doctors said that these results may stem from current stressfull phases according to them my past is not related to current hormonal imbalances

pmo addiction and depression  anxiety i’m in an odd state regarding fapping and anxiety disorder including panic attacks and depression i’ve noticed that when i fap excessively these psychological symptoms worsen  makes sense right but also when i go on nofap these psychological symptoms also worsen which you’d normally not expect due to the hormonal changes associated with nofap  i am thinking this is due to withdrawal effects as a result of nofap but i’m not sure in fact my anxiety and depression is at its lowest at an equilibrium point of fapping once per 2 days but i am still having psychological effects even then  i really think my pmo addiction is causing these mental issues i’ve noticed a very strong correlation with my fapping  increased mental effects there’s also been cases of pmo addiction tampering with hormone levels and causing increased levels of depression and anxiety do you think that it’s possible my pmo addiction is the underlying cause to my anxiety  depression and is causing hormonal changes if so then after how long after i quit fapping can i expect for the psychological symptoms subside and i’ll be normal again the reason i ask this is because i mentioned before that my anxiety and depression flare up after i quit fapping so how long before this subsides and i’ll have no more anxiety and depression to worry about how can i be fully sure that nofap will eradicate all my psychological problems and that after i go in nofap there won’t still be any remaining lingering depression or anxiety,1

"so confused by symptoms please help  since about march on and off i’ve been waking up with a pounding heart feeling it’s usually 40 mins to an hour after feeling asleep it was causing me bad panic attacks at first i went to hospital because it started racing after i woke up like that but it raced after the pounding stopped because i was worried something was wrong with my heart had an ecg but it was normal just a slightly fast heart rate of 91 

it’ll stop sometimes for a week or a few nights and then it starts again it’s not super fast when it happens and if i don’t react to it it goes away very fast 

i’ve managed to control my panic around it a bit which is good 

i think i wake up and then it starts to pound a bit rather than it’s pounding and it wakes me up but i can’t be 100 sure it’s like a little adrenaline shot 

last night i woke my boyfriend to listen and he said it was a bit fast but when he put his head on my chest he said it suddenly slowed back down now i’m terrified about svt because i’m sure with that it suddenly goes back to normal whereas with anxiety it would slowly go back to normal 

different things have helped at first i started using a fan and it went away for a bit and then came back then i bought an eye mask and it stopped for two nights and came back again 

i’ve also noticed a little bit of acid reflux right after it happens but i get this when i’m anxious so i can’t say if that’s connected at all 

i had a 24 hour holter but haven’t had the results of that yet 

i also had an ecg at my doctors and they said this was normal too waiting on a sleep study too 

has anyone had anything like this can anxiety wake you up like that but then stop really fast

"how to deal with stress hives or how to reduce stress that can lead to hives  the title pretty much sums it up but i’ll be giving more context if you’d rather not look through my other posts i am posting from a throwaway account due to paranoia

 i m19 started developing stress hives since monday this morning they had started going away but today i had an episode not too long ago and am overall in an extremely bad place mentally my hives are coming back not in huge amounts but slightly and i’m wanting to reduce them in any way possible 

i’ve been doing my best to relax but i’m generally an extremely paranoid person for context i have bpd ocd and i’m currently separated from my fp until monday therefore isolated and just generally in a really bad place mentally it feels like the world is ending i know it’s not but my thought process is extremely irrational specifically right now

is there any coping skills i can take into account is there anything i can do to reduce stress or my stress hives i want to handle this the best i can before it worsens i’ve already had to go to the hospital for this i’ve fainted  i’ve been injected with two different things and i was off my medication for two days straight medication that i’ve been put back on by my psychiatrist 

any advice is very appreciated",1

"when do you know a therapist has crossed a line vs just made a mistake hello

i just had a traumatic experience with my therapist who for the most part i like

i am sorry that i have to be so vague i just dont feel comfortable going into too much detail it involved them pushing me to do something in my life that is very sensitive and triggering i tried to explain to them over and over why i dont feel comfortable doing this thing and why i dont feel it is necessary but they continued to push it

i did tell my therapist it was triggering during the session after i emailed them and told them they crossed the line with me and they apologized the issue is that im paranoid they were trying to make a point or insinuate something negative about me that suggests they dont trust certain things im telling them this is all me making an assumption and based on my own trauma but i feel so uncomfortable with them that im not sure about doing another session

can anyone here give me examples of when your therapist truly crossed the line or when it was a misunderstanding",1

"petrified i have a brain tumor i’m so stressed i can’t relax please help  20f title says it all it’s an on and off worry i’ve had for a while last month i had some headaches and they’ve come back i have horrible health anxiety

they aren’t horrible at all very mild and forgettable and sometimes all over sometimes just ice pick headaches but i’m not a headachey person so it’s scared me contrary to my mum and sister who get headaches and migraines a lot the ache goes away with one paracetamol but i find myself waiting for it to happen and wondering if i’ll get one

it’s really scared me also because i’ve become aware that i’m messing up my words lately and sometimes things i say don’t make sense or i repeat words it’s become really difficult because now i’m hyper focused on how i’m talking and i’m stressing even more idk if it’s adhd related i’m undiagnosed but very obviously have it i’ll say things like “who’s hand is hands” when i meant to say “who’s hand is who’s” and today when ordering a coffee i just completely blanked and could only get a string of uhm and uhs out i am so so so so so so so scared

i know there’s hundreds of things that would explain all of this anxiety for one but i’m not anxious when these things happen i also have known back and neck problems and tight muscles i don’t sleep well 6 hours in total but it’s very broken i don’t eat properly because i have an eating disorder so usually i just eat once in 24 hours i’m not exactly healthy and my hormones are a fucking mess

but i just can’t shake the dread of this being something horrible and it’s all i think about majority of the time i’m on my period right now and it’s not helping could also be causing it idk my family keep telling me i’m fine i cant relax but i’m terrified to go to the doctors incase it actually is something and then boom i’m dying and lose all my hair and oh my god in stressing so bad please help it’s also hot as fuck here and i’m probs not drinking enough but my logic isn’t enough ",1

though for some reason i just cannot grasp it i make stupid mistakes because i’m too anxious about it when i drive i can do nothing but focus on making sure i don’t accidentally screw up which then sends me into a spiral 
i have had many close calls when i was first learning to drive because i was too caught up in my anxiety and those close calls only made it worse i have this crippling fear of causing an accident and seriously harming someone i feel like i will lose control and get confused i have a fear of having an anxiety attack on the road and causing a crash

i will only drive locally and even then i’m still scared to do so i get in trouble by my parents because they say it’s a ridiculous fear i know it is but i can’t get better the more i try to expose myself to the far road the more i screw up

i just got yelled at because i didnt answer when asked if i wanted to go pick something up i was thinking and playing out my options eventually i got told my fear was stupid and that i needed to get over myself i was told i was being an inconvenience to everyone around me and that i was dependent like a baby 

it may be true but damn it hurt

"health anxiety  the anxious thought that i have a brain tumor appeared in my anxious mind and will not go away i’m not usually someone to experience health anxiety but i just can’t shake this one 

to be fair i have been having more headaches than i usually do but i think it’s related to caffeine withdrawal no headaches until i’ve gone a few hours since i last drank coffee i even messaged my neurologist about it and he said that it’s likely related to caffeine 

i had an eeg done recently for other reasons and a cat scan on my head about a year ago blood work a few months ago and i am perfectly healthy lol

 any advice obviously getting an mri done to know i don’t have one for sure would relive my anxiety but feels unnecessary since i don’t have any reason to believe i have a brain tumor besides getting occasional headaches it’s hard to not let the anxious thoughts in when i do get these dull headaches kind of regularly

"anxious about apartment lease  moving not sure where to start but i’ll try to keep it short

i just moved in with my boyfriend we signed a 15 month lease this is my first time living on my own technically 

we moved around a lot when i was a kid and never stayed in one spot more than a year until i was in high school my parents kicked me out of that house that i had lived in for the longest i had to throw away 98 of my sentimental and personal belongings in one night and i ended up on a mattress on the floor at my sisters house which i’m grateful to her for anyways i lived with her for about 3 years and in between those years we moved to a new place and i never got too comfortable any place else out of fear that i would have to throw away all my stuff again

now at this apartment i can’t help but feel anxious when i try to decorate and furnish because i feel like it’s pointless since we’re moving again ‘soon’ my brain keeps telling me i have to start packing soon even though i just moved in it’s eating me up and i can’t relax i keep telling myself if i renew the lease would i feel better would that trick my brain into thinking i have more time before all of me goes into a box

"do you find that planning your day and writing down your lists to do keeps your stress level down hey guys

 i definitely see myself as a stressful person sometimes the stress can even affect my health where i have muscle back pain   


im curious to know how others who identify themselves as easily stressful people do to cope with this and where the stress comes from in the first place is it usually with not being able to get all of your tasks done   


i know procrastination can lead to stress when you realize you have to rush to get all of your things completed   


thats why im curious to know if writing down and planning your day at the start of teh day actually helps you relax and do you feel better having sense of control that you get your day completed with essential tasks so there is less things to worry

"any goodsimple ways to deal with anxiety hi i am new to the subreddit i am 16f about to turn 17 and i unfortunately have anxiety issues i tend to overthink dread over scenarios make minor problems seem bigger etc
ive tried to talk about my anxiety to my friends and family but they mostly scold me or give me the silent treatment for even thinking that way my anxieties are mostly because of my health issues i have type 2 diabetes subclinical hypothryoidism and an ongoing mild uti thats being treated right now

"urgent therapy session in 20mins please help i’m not sure what to do i have a question and really need someone else’s opinion advice or answer to the question that i’m stressing over and very worried about right now this is my first time ever posting here and i am so sorry if this is the wrong place to post this if it is would someone be able to point me in the right direction and i will happily take this post down

so for context 
i’ve had a long history of inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations due to bpd and suicidal thoughts that have lead to a diagnosis of ptsd i’m petrified of hospitals now any type of professional and even just regular doctor’s offices i’m currently seeing a therapist after a couple of years reluctant to trying to have therapy again 
long story short i finally crumbled under all the stress and attempted suicide two nights ago if it was not for a friend who showed up 
eerily not even 30secs in time i would be dead right now
i am contemplating telling my therapist about what happened today in our session but am absolutely terrified that she will force me to go inpatient 

my question is 
does she legally have to report and take action against my attempt and force me to check myself in somewhere even though it was over 24hrs ago and i am no longer feeling the same level of distress i was then i also don’t have any plan or intention on going through with anything as of now either and feel rather safe with myself at the moment i’m just so scared to open up in fear i’ll have to go to the hospital
thanks in advance for anyone’s who may be able to help me understand how this works

i got to the airport today and i was trying my best to stay calm but i felt like i was going to pass out by the time i got out of my car i had to sit down because i couldn’t breath and i was getting dizzy but eventually i got inside i’ve never been in an airport so i was just following what my mom said and we got turned around a lot 

i’m also really really scared of elevators because once i got stuck in an elevator for like half an hour when i was going to therapy once and ever since i refuse to enter an elevator my mom said i had to go in the elevator and i got through it but then we had to go through like 4 other elevators after because we kept going to to wrong places and i started crying but briefly because i refuse to let myself show emotion in public 

turns out my flight was tomorrow so we had to go all the way back i convinced my mom to let me go down the stairs for one of them but when we got back to the parking garage i had to go in the elevator i thought i’d be fine but i got in and there was this beeping sound and it freaked me out and i started freaking out i don’t think i’ve ever freaked out this much in public i was sobbing and pulling my hair until i got out of it and even after i was crying until we left

i just feel so stupid i feel like i’m being ridiculous and embarrassing i mean i’m almost 18 i should be able to use a fucking elevator my body just freaks out when i get in one it also didint help there was a bunch of people and it was super loud i just can’t do it now i’m dreading going back tomorrow",1

i 17f started going out with this guy from my class 17m and recently found out that he had sad his exes and sexually harassed numerous others including my younger cousin 16f 

im rarely in school so i didnt know about his reputation i found this out earlier today from my aunt cousins mom 

he told me about how things didnt go well with his exes but not the reason why i found out from my aunt that when his ex broke things off with him he didnt take lightly to it and sad her 

i am very shy and awkward ive never had a boyfriend or had anyone even remotely interested in me he told me that he liked me for a long time and i could definitely tell i dont really put myself out there sexually and i prefer to take things slowly im scared that because of this hell try to hurt me

i have to see him during an exam next week and im terrified i havent broken things off with him yet and im just trying to act friendly until after exams but im not good at masking my emotions and im worried that hell notice and do something 

i had already told him approximately where i live and where im going to school next he has a very strange sense of humor often undermining death and tragedy he often says mildly mean and judgemental things to me playing it off as im just saying this because im comfortable around you me being naive believed him

im worried that because he has already marked me as his next target he wont take lightly to me breaking things off either 

i already have bad anxiety but this has made it so much worse my chest is tense and i feel like i cant breathe because i am so worried about this i have had a fear of being sexually assaulted for a long time and now its getting all too possible i need to do good on my exams because i have to meet conditional offers for my university but i just cant stop thinking about this

does anybody here have experience with this sort of thing can you give me advice and help me calm down before exams

i had no history of food allergies before this past one month and now it feels like i’m allergic to so many things i already have ocd and health anxiety and this is becoming a new theme for me

i’ve always had a sorescratchy throat with a couple of fruits  which i found out could be oas so i stay away from them 

then i moved out of my family home about a month ago and now it’s like i’m ‘allergic’ to everything i know that’s it’s possible to suddenly start becoming allergic to things but i thought it was very rare 

living alone it scares me because if i go into anaphylactic shock nobody will be able to help me i read more about oas and food allergies and became more scared of eating things that i usually eat 

over the last month i’ve reacted to 

boiled broccolicauliflower a plain oats  nature valley bar sauerkraut and plain tortilla chips very random things  i know 

my symptoms

i would feel some anxiety before eating then my lips and tongue tingling my throat feeling dry feeling like there’s a lump in my throat pins and needles in my hands and feet my heart will start racing my face tinglingburningfeeling numb my legs start feeling like jelly my head feels tight and i feel lightheaded i have to run to the bathroom and have loose stool tmi sorry 

they all come and go which makes me think it’s anxiety  but i have seen people say there can be delayed reactions or anaphylaxis can sometimes be unnoticeable but then it can happen rapid and your throat closes

last week i ate some tinned baked beans on its own  same brand i had eaten about 2 weeks ago i had some anxiety felt like my lips were tingling and started panicking within a few minutes i had loose stool

now i feel anxious about eating everything it depends on how ‘in my head’ i feel before eating it last night i ate some oats and had the same symptoms i mentioned above and i also had some brown bread today  same feeling both foods i’ve been eating all week and last week etc but i also felt some anxiety before eating these things

hi i lied about having an abortion to my ex he stood me up on saturday at edc las vegas and i got extremely pissed i then told all his friends and family that i’m still pregnant and then he got super mad

 i told him i would do the abortion if he hung out with me on sunday but then i acted crazy because i told him to meet me in the car before the last day of the event and nd i wanted to kiss and hug but he wanted to leave in 10 seconds because he was mad and then i pulled his shirt so he couldn’t leave and then he started choking me and he twisted my wrist 

then on tuesday i called his work so many times to ask where he was and if we can get back together and he said no i acted so crazy all this is my fault  i should’ve just kept lying to him about the abortion and i could’ve kept him around for a little bit longer i miss him so much i hate my life why do people have to get hurt like this it’s not worth it at all

"i dont know what to do  is my period suddenly causing terrible anxiety hi i posted on here not too long ago 2 days before my last period ironically enough asking for advice on how to cope with physical symptoms of anxiety but now im just here to vent about my situation as a whole any advice or personal stories and experiences would be greatly appreciated

a little background i 17f started bc about 2 months ago for only a week and had what i would consider a somewhat traumatic experience 
severe anxiety panic attacks nausea queasiness motion sickness in the car vmiting low appetite weakness emotional instability etc
i could hardly move or leave my bed without feeling sick crying and panicking ever since that experience i havent been the same regarding my mental health specifically anxiety i was already diagnosed with gad years prior to this so feeling anxious isnt something new to me but ive never experienced it to this extent until these past 2 months end of april  now my anxiety has become increasingly debilitating and out of control especially around that time of the month which is exactly whats happening right now

this week has been really hard on me these past few days it feels like all ive been able to do successfully is lay in bed and cry ive been crying almost constantly and uncontrollably i feel uncomfortable in my own mind and body i experience panic attacks more often im dissociating my stomach feels uneasy low appetite eye twitching shakiness im nervous to eat sleep shower be alone leave my house for extended periods of time and sometimes i cant even leave my room or bed i feel useless and helpless and not at all like myself or the way i was prior to my bc experience

i have no real leads on why my anxiety has become like this all of the sudden there are no big events or changes that im consciously anxious about it just seems as though a week or 2 before my period is due i become increasingly anxious about minor everyday things that i would typically do without a second thought
i feel so lost im only almost 18 years old and more often than not i feel like i cant get anything done or do things i enjoy without being scared or creating a safety net for myself which is exhausting of course there are good days where everything is almost back to normal again and i experience relief after my period hits but the bad days are really bad and they make it extremely difficult for me to see the big picture

"feeling on edgefeeling sth terrible will happen i suffered from anxiety depression and ocd ever since i was a little child especially health has always been a big issue for me i was in self isolation for the past year and it took a toll on my anxiety i’m doing better now doing therapy and it does help however this one strange feeling stayed i often feel constantly on edge even when there is nothing coming up that could trigger my anxiety like having to leave my house for a large period of time having to meet with many strangers or other scheduled appointments this feeling that sth bad will happen often comes randomly to me and ever since knowing that it’s called “feeling of impending doom” and knowing it often occurs in patients with medical emergencies it scares me shitless every time i get this i now wonder if sth is wrong with my body and it’s crying for help i have regular check ups where my heart is looked at my blood and at the moment my stomach is getting checked having problem with histamine am already on a diet but stomach is still having issues now and then so i should be safe but i don’t feel safe i always expect to just fall over and pass out or worse… feeling tired and dizzy and having brain fog from my current medication doesn’t help it all adds to the pile of stress and atm it’s hard for me to enjoy things because i keep waiting for that feeling or sth bad happening

also had a scheduled meeting that week that stressed me for weeks and with it now gone i have nothing to obsess over no real threat that i can grasp maybe that makes it worse

maybe some of you went through the same thing and have some advice thanks in advance d",1
"my 21st birthday is coming up  i m20 have a problem and heres the problem thats been eating away at me for months i dont know what i want to do for my birthday like i really dont know what to do ive been thinking and thinking about what i should do for it but i cant think of anything at all

my 21st birthday is literally 4 days away and because its my 2ist i feel like i should do something big for it or have been made to feel like i should do something big

my mum has given me some suggestions she suggested that me her my older brother and my younger brother go to a restaurant but invite my dad and my younger brother and sister who live in weymouth a town 3 hours away

i havent seen my younger brother and sister 67 months all because of my severe social anxiety im ashamed that i havent spoken to them in so long so them meeting my older brother who theyve never met is for some reason been grating on me even though it should not itss just so many family members in public with me feels overwhelming even though its happened to me before with other family members

as you can see im a severe overthinker im extremely aware of it itss my biggest problem that has effected me for years and am still trying to find a way to overcome it as also my social anxiety

my mum has said to me that i always do this i leave stuff until the very last minute and want to them shes said that i do this on my birthday every year and i just realized until she told me a week or two ago she wants me to let her know that i should do something or not do something at all its my choice

my aunt has offered for me to come down with her on may 30th to weymouth to spend time with the family but i ghosted her

my granny who also lives in weymouth has offered to take me down to tgi fridays but i also ghosted her

my dad also offered to have my birthday in weymouth while on the phone but i evaded the question

i dont mean to do that them i just get extremely overwhelmed by those thoughts and didnt know how to respond

i remember back in december my dad suggested to me that i have a birthday week but i dismissed him but thought to myself that that may or may not be a bad idea now it might be a good idea i dont know

even now writing this is fucking me up i just dont know what to do i just need some advice or help",1

x200b

i have severe anxiety and ocd i am 23 in grad school i have no family history of mental illness besides ocd

i was recently diagnosed with ocd but i have had the tendencies my entire life and this bad high really brought it out and was even hospitalized for it in the past due to the extreme anxiety unrelated to this story

so this happened about 3 months ago right after finals i wanted to relax so i got high i had to pass drug tests for my coop so my tolerance was very low and i took more than i normally do and i was also high alone in my college apartment which is never the case

i was playing cod with my buddies online i took way too much edible 120 mg and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine of reign so then i thought i heard something and i ripped my headphones off and it sounded like my neighborssomeone in the hallway but i was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment

this made me super anxious because i thought what i was hearing was not real but in hindight it probably was then my friends got off and i stayed on because i was super anxious that i would hear something and i wanted them to stay on because i thought i was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when i took my headphones off then when i eventually did take my headphones off i was so tired and anxious

this led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible conversationi also had a ton of white noise in my room and this made me freak out into a panic attack because i thought i was in psychosis i had no delusions messages or anything from what i thought i heard  my tinnitus was so bad always is when i am high that i couldnt tell where i was coming from but it sounded like white noise in my apartment i went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until i googled schizophrenia symptoms and now i am very anxious about getting it


this has made grad school near impossible this semester and i am struggling under the stress of school and this stupid crap i should have never done

sorry that is a lot but i do not think like that anymore do i have any reasons to be concerned at all is this normal i am sorry i just wish i never got high and i am scared i screwed up my mind and my career yes i am not getting high ever again

once again my pcp psych and 2 therapists are not concerned but i am this anxiety has been extreme because i am so scared of schizophrenia

my psych said this

he was extremely confident that i didn’t experience psychosis and that my anxiety was making me hear stuff because i was anxious about hearing stuff

he said audio distortions can happen with extreme anxiety and combine that with the psychoactive ingredients in thc it caused me to freak out  

he also said in 25 years hes been a psychiatrist he has seen psychosis and people with “nondecript” symptoms that i have experienced  he said he has never had someone develop a psychotic disorder with nondescript symptoms that i had experienced

now when i am sober and obsessed with psychosis my brain kind of makes nothing clear or delusions or voices giving commands or legible conversationsmusic in white noise and my tinnitus makes it worse  this only happens when i am anxious and scared",1
depersonalization anyone  hey everyone  i hope your weekends are going well so far i have gad and have been off lexapro for six months after being on it for seven years and it’s been a ride relearning myself and feeling everything deeper— physically and mentally sometimes i get so overwhelmed by life that i fall into depersonalization i think because i don’t have any verbal thoughts which may seem strange but feelings instead i feel like i’m masking my anxiety a lot and hate talking about it with my fiancé because i don’t want to worry him or bring him down sometimes i’ll force myself to talk to myself in my head— does anyone else have a similar experience i know it’s so oddly specific  does anyone have any other ideas for snapping out of depersonalization besides grounding techniques,1

"dae get migraines caused by stressanxiety i don’t often get migraines but i do very often get stressed out or anxious 

i’ve only had about 5 migraines in 15 years but just this month i’ve had two migraines that affected my vision for about 30 minutes at a time and then gone away either with no headache or just a very slight headache 

the stress i’ve been experiencing has been the following

my mom having cancer for the past year and dealing with her treatments 

my brother having kidney failure and heart problems

just generally caring for our toddler

attempting to get pregnant and even feeling like i was pregnant but ultimately was not 

dizziness and nausea every time i feel anxious or stressed 

so in an attempt to feel better i went to the doctor who ran a bunch of blood work and that showed i have a very slight chance of an autoimmune disease present but they’re not sure it’s been weeks that i’ve been worried that i have something horribly wrong with me 

i went to a rheumatologist today and just based on my bloodwork and physical exam and the answers to their questions they think there’s nothing wrong but ran bloodwork anyway i feel like i finally am taking steps in the right direction but it’s almost like once i let my guard down i got that migraine that makes my vision look like a kaleidoscope for about half an hour i did my best not to panic and it did go away but i just feel so out of control

"struggling any help appreciated  hi everyone 

struggling with anxiety and can feel myself going into the black hole 

i don’t do well with confrontation had an awful interaction with one of my neighbours we are currently having a boundary dispute well not a dispute even we are in the right which he admits but as it stands at the moment without resolution we can’t sell our property i went round there to try and discuss i was really polite but he just talks over me and called me stupid he wouldn’t let me get a sentence out and is a typical misogynistic old man that thinks women are lower in society i tried to stick up for myself as he is cast iron in the wrong and i just wanted to resolve it on a friendly level but there is no speaking to him  he knows best even though he’s been categorically proven wrong on everything so far

during the discussion i was shaking and cold and have felt beside myself with anxiety since then it ruined my weekend last week and i can’t shift the feelings i’ve tried all my other coping mechanisms but nothing is working i’m going to have to get solicitors involved and go down the legal route which is going to cost me but i don’t have a choice we’ve been really reasonable offering to pay to resolve the issue so it doesn’t cost him etc anyway the point of me spilling out my life story is that as much as i’d like this issue to resolve itself it’s going to be a long battle and so i don’t think my anxiety is going to lift any time soon

i feel like life is really short to have moments spoilt by this but i can’t shake the feelings at all i don’t have to interact with him again but until the issue is resolved it feels like an open wound anyone have any recommendations it’s been a week and a half i’ve tried meditation journaling deep breathing cold and heat therapy i am very emotional and teary it just seems to be consuming me which is so bloody stupid

i sometimes wanna be attracted to men and have gay thoughts and it makes me aroused cause i feel feminine because of it
then i just feel bad and ashamed i am straight in terms of my birth sex and i dont hate it but sometimes it makes me feel invalid and bad and wants me to erase or switch my attraction to man only

"panic attacks and losing hope hi everyone

  
i started having panic attacks one year ago when i was in a really highpressure engineering school while living abroad and alone at 18 years old i quit that school due to horrible mental and emotional abuse from teachers and the extreme amount of stress and returned to my country 

  
i was quickly diagnosed with panic disorder and had the most horrible panic attacks every single day for months i did counselling and a couple of sessions of emdr therapy for six months now its been one year and i went to study abroad again and changed my degree but after all this therapy im still experiencing panic attacks 

  
even though theyre not as frequent once every 12 weeks and not as intense as they were before i am so exhausted from battling with this i still have horrible anxious thoughts and nights where i cannot breathe and feel like im dying 

  
i am starting to lose hope that this disease will ever go away i am so scared and getting depressed and hopeless and the fact that im alone in a foreign country is not helping

"when does the cycle stop  hello people

i hope you’re all okay 

sadly i’m back

as a back story when i was 15 lost my cousin to a rare heart condition we still aren’t sure exactly what it was

at 15 and 16 i had 24 hours monitor ecg and echo all perfect

went through some trauma then at 19 had my first anxiety battle palpitations skipped beats racing heart flutters were all part of it went to doctor did a mini ecg and was perfect and the resssurance made them go away has the odd few over 3 years after eating etc 

then at 22 for my cousin charity i put myself forward to have another ecg the anxiety of having a test was unbearable for 2 weeks everyday i would have thuds in my chests really bad and as soon as i had the test and they said its perfect again they disappeared for 2 years had the odd ones when eating 

now last year i was eating a mcdonald’s and that gave me a few palpitations i made the mistake of feeling my pulse which i could feel my heart skips beats and double beat this was horrifying i went to my room my heart racing at like 170bpm thinking i am going to die anyway i didn’t die the next day i woke up and the whole day i started to get like 20 which in turn caused more anxiety and more checking pulse then after about 4 months of it most days i called the doctor she said she would give me a 24 hour monitor wish i would of taken it but we decided they sound like ectopic beats and the monitor would cause more anxiety well i thought that little resssurance would help guess what it didn’t

a year later of having palpitations most fays like 10 times a day skips and thuds here i am still getting them

but 3 weeks ago i had had some garlic sauce the night before and at 5am i woke up my heart skipping like 23 beats in a row it was terrible missing so many beats i thought this is the worst i’ve ever had it i am going to die i battled it for four hours until it started to ‘hurt’ so me and my wife went to the emergency room they did an ecg my heart rate was 150bpm but they said the test looked okay but my heart was too fast and blood pressure was high from the stress

anyway they put me into redid because my heart rate was 160 bpm i had a heart monitor attached and a blood pressure machine so they can see everything i thought i really am having a heart attack the cardiologist comes in and speaks to me i told him to look at the monitor when it ‘hurt’ and skipped a beat low and behold they were just ectopics 

i was getting like 2 in a row maybe three thinking i was going to die i had pretty much everytype of palpitation feeling and he kept saying don’t be scared they can’t harm you it’s just ectopics after about 2 hours on the heart monitor they did my blood tests because my heart monitor was fine and it’s just ectopics my blood tests came back low potassium and phosphate anyway 2 weeks later i did repeat blood test and everything is perfect now so maybe the anxiety drained my body of them two things 

the palpitations can feel like skips flutters a warm sensation like gad travelling down my chest i get mainly a bit after eating or in the morning another way i describe which might sound dramatic is like your hearts beating and then it gets stuck to your ribcage and it takes a  second to pull its self of the ribs 

now i was booked in for 24 hour monitor to catch a palpitation to diagnose it but because they diagnosed it as ectopics i’m not having it now 2 weeks later after all that reassurance i’m still getting 310 skips and thuds and double beats a day

i’m starting to fall back into the what if there is something wrong  

does it sound like i’ve had enough reassurance 

why haven’t they stopped after getting reassurance

i’m guessing my heart is healthy and no further testing is neeeded

will they stop one day

"im not recovering from my burnout i already quit study 2 years ago what caused my burnout in the first place was the combination of homework and problems in my private life like depression and friendships not going well i was already overloaded with stress half a year before i quit studying i quit way too late i got deep into burnout

so 2 years ago i quit studying been home 247 ever since then had cbt therapy for depression didnt help a bit got addicted to gaming cause i had nothing else to do now im not addicted to gaming anymore but still addicted to the internet in general im still at very very very low energy levels

i actually feel more mentally tired than the moment i quit studying so it seems like even though i dropped the mountains of homework im not recovering my burnout but its actually getting worse

i think its because stress is always present in my life im depressed and have autism my life is not going the way i want so i have alot of problems both in my head and in my environment also my dad died 4 months ago kind of unexpectedly

what also makes recovery hard for me is the fact that im always impatient i always want my problems to be solved my todo list to be empty so even though i feel tired and unmotivated and am uable to get significant amounts of work done i still always have the urge to either do or worry about my todo list i cannot really relax even if i try to relax if i ride my bike or play a game it just doesnt feel relaxing because i know that after the activity my todo list with 1000 things is still there waiting for me

at this point is recovery just impossible for me i feel lost i dont know what to do anymore",1

"struggling mentally hi everyone i’m generally a positive guy i’m always looking out for my friends and family regularly hitting the gym running hiking travelling the uk just generally a proactive person 

life took a turn for the worst in 2022 when my partners father passed away we were in london at the time and didn’t make it back in time to see him before his passing the following year my mother’s mother passed away while we were abroad and she couldn’t be with her while she passed i feel like i’ve been trying to hold it together not only for my sake but for theirs so we can all get through this during this time my sister also had a complete mental breakdown and that was incredibly difficult for us all too she is doing better now but still off slightly 

this year about 3 weeks ago my partner has decided to move to london for university but in order to do so she has to sell all of her personal belongings get rid of our cats a lot of the items and memories that we’ve made here and this has honestly crippled and pushed me over the edge i’m currently at a point where i’m regularly thinking of suicide although i’m certain i wouldn’t do it but the thoughts just come up and it’s honestly f ing scary she doesn’t get along with life here and as much as it hurts me i feel like it would be a fresh start for her to gain independence we’ve been together for 5 and a half years now we don’t plan holidays together and she seems completely focussed on this new life but i know how hard she finds life and i’m also scared that when she’s down there it could also cripple her she has a good group of friends here the only issue is they don’t live closeby a few towns over 

life feels like a complete whirlwind i just feel like i’ve done a complete 180 spin from the positive person i was who looked after myself really well to a complete stranger i don’t know how to hold it together or what to do i’m incredibly insecure recently i’m feeling incredibly lonely i feel like i’m letting my family down it’s all incredibly overwhelming and scary i would absolutely love some help through this please ",1
"anxiety  propanolol hello 

i was prescribed 10 mg of propanolol twice a day  once a day or as needed for panic disorder i have been taking one every day for almost 2 months it was amazing at first i was finding so much relief i was able to go and do things i would normally have a hard time with go to the grocery store gym our with friends etc 

last week i was getting a lot of anxiety due to outside stressors all temporary however i feel as though my reaction is not normal at all i have been so emotional i feel absolutely insane i’ve been crying randomly scared anxious fear of being out in public and have the worst intrusive thoughts i’ve ever had feeling depressed and not wanting to do much of anything or feeling too anxious to do anything i feel dissociated and uncomfortable in my surroundings 

if i am occupying myself it goes away but it’s very hard to stop thinking about 

my anxiety feels like it has tripled but my panic feels like it’s subsided i am not having the same reaction as i typically would when i am anxious it feels as though my nervous system was shocked and shut down i feel like i have no control over myself i feel crazy is this making sense 

i am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with propranolol has it made you more anxious but helped with panic attacks usually i feel those go hand in hand but i am feeling like my anxiety has kicked up quite a bit and my panic attacks have been less intense what did you do to help yourself

i did ask my psychiatrist and she said that it is a low dose so it is more than likely not the bb what are your thoughts",1

"hey i wish to share a personal experience on stress and how i overcame it story time meditation has made a big difference in my life and i want to share how its touched me deeply  
i remember when i first started meditating life was stressful and i was overwhelmed with work and the noisy city around me stress and anxiety were always there making my health and relationships suffer a friend suggested meditation and though i was skeptical i decided to give it a try  
at first meditating felt like a struggle my mind was used to racing thoughts and distractions so sitting quietly and focusing on my breath was hard but i kept at it knowing that change takes time  
as i practised meditation i noticed changes in how i handled stress i became calmer and clearer when dealing with tough situations instead of getting lost in my feelings i could step back and watch my thoughts without judging them this helped me make better decisions and deal with problems more effectively i started watching many youtube videos on meditation and today i found the best of them all a true gem that really has changed my perspective if you wanna watch it here is the link   i hope it helps someone else like it helped me  
meditation also had a big impact on my mental health i had been dealing with anxiety and occasional depression for a while and relied on medication to cope but with meditation i started feeling more at peace and content than ever before it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and i even needed less medication which my doctor helped me with  
my relationships improved too meditation helped me become more understanding and empathetic towards others i became a better listener and communicator making my connections with friends and family deeper and more meaningful  
physically i slept better had more energy and experienced fewer headaches and stressrelated health issues i felt healthier and happier overall  
one unexpected gift was finding my purpose and direction in life through meditation i gained clarity about my goals and passions which led me to pursue things that truly mattered to me  
meditation hasnt magically solved all my problems but it has been a powerful tool for selfdiscovery and personal growth it has brought me mindfulness resilience and inner peace and im excited to see how it continues to shape my life im deeply grateful for the positive impact it has had on every part of my life meditation isnt just a change its a heartfelt transformation",1

could ssris help me  hey guys ive been having a really rough time recently for some background i struggled with anxiety from a young age and i first went to therapy in 2021 where i was diagnosed with depression and panic disorder and i had high scores for ocd anxiety paranoia and hipochondria with that i was prescribed paxil 10 mg a day and took it for 6 months and it helped with nothing at all the psychiatrist didnt want to make my dose bigger or let me switch meds so i just stopped i have had horrible anxiety since the beggining of this year and have started seeing a new therapist seeing her for 6 months now we have been doing breathwork and positive thinking therapy but it really isnt helping she has recommended me pills not sure if its things like benzos or ssris didnt want to take them so i just declined every time she mentioned pills and now i have seriously started thinking about it i am in a constant state of panic and have started getting regular panic attacks the thoughts i have are that i feel like i am going crazy or eventually will and i feel like i dont know what is normal everything sets me off and its horrible i cant distract myself i bought some plant based calming pills and i take them now every time i panic but i dont know if they do much because my thoughts are still the same i am afraid that i will forever be in this thought loop  i am really sad about it because my life is normal and i have no issues with people in my life or my life situation over all if it matters i am 22 f can someone give me advice if this was your mindset before and you managed to overcome it because i feel so helpless and i hate talking about this because it makes the issue more real and if someone can explain to me until i have my next therapy session in a little bit over a week how would ssris work do they make your body calm or do they make your mindset better as well again the ones i was on really didnt do anything apart from give me brain zaps as withdrawl i hope someone will respond i dont think my state of mind has ever been this bad  ,1

i can recognize that there is a lot going on in my life there are like 4 different things happening tommorow that are triggering my anxiety but i obviously can’t just turn off the tightness in my chest or the restlessness i feel because of the anticipation for what is to come 
i often feel alone like no one else has anxiety or the things i get nervous over are stupid and embarrassing like others would judge me if they knew what was going through my head despite the things i get anxious over feeling very real to me in the moment i pick important things or make things that aren’t too impactful super serious and like if i fail at something my life is ruined

"i need you help i was at a party one and a half years ago where i drunk quite a bit not enough to blackout or throw up and i was able to convincingly act sober towards my parents
well…
my friend told me about 9 months ago about a thing i said and i didn’t remember it 
she basically told me i told her that i did coke which i don’t do of course but i allegedly told her that
after she told me and i thought back to the party i could remember the other things i said more clearly and also vaguely remembered the coke thing
then i of course had some anxiety but calmed it quite easily 
now for the past few weeks i worry so much about what i may or may not have said besides that or if maybe someone filmed me or listened to our talk
i know it is very unlikely as i could very well talk to my parents after the party can remember almost the entire night even after 1 12 years later and no signs point to anything else happening i even asked my friend whether or not i told her anything else that was weird and she denied it twice

"went on my first ever date last week and unfortunately blew it  i just felt like sharing my experience its a bit on the longer side but i just feel like chatting 

so im on the older side for never have been dating 24 ive had a couple soft dates with friends but never specifically with romantic intention ive mostly avoided the dating world due to living situation and anxiety but recently just really felt the need to try and meet someone 

i matched with this really really gorgeous girl on   a dating app definitely felt out of my league  but started talking and it seemed to be going well we had a good deal of similar interests

after talking for a around a week she ended up asking me to dinner which i felt really good about i was incredibly nervous about meeting her we were meeting up at a bar and grill type place i dont drink so a bar is especially not my type of place my anxiety was insane i got here 10 minutes early and grabbed a table sitting there and not walking away was one of the hardest moments of my life my heart felt like it was going to explode my watch clocked in at up to 150 

when she got there it was a little awkward for the first couple minutes but once the conversation started going things went really well we talked about all sorts of stuff books we read shows we liked family i was definitely feeling a lot better about the entire situation i was barely able to touch my food because my stomach was churning from the entire experience 

our date lasted about an hour and a half i paid for the food and when we were wrapping things up she asked to go back to my place my heart sank i didnt think in a million years she would ask to do that maybe its my fault for using tinder but there was no indication up to this point she would want to hook up with me maybe thats what she was asking maybe it wasnt i was in a bad situation 

i didnt know what to say i stuttered and told her id rather go a little slower she looked really disappointed and shocked there was very little said past this point id very clearly killed the vibe and ruined the date i felt so bad i still do i sent her a lengthy text the next day thanking her for the night out expressing id like to see her again and that i was sorry things ended abruptly unfortunately its been a few days since then and i havent heard back she hasnt unmatched me but i could never stomach to reach out again 

i feel so bad it makes me feel sick thinking about it my friends assured me i didnt do anything wrong but it feels like i did if nothing else i did enjoy the night a little once things got going but damn man i sure feel shitty it was a huge deal to me and i feel miserable i see the ups of course but the downs are mostly what im stuck on 

i just wanted to share my experience with people as i said even though this isnt that big of a deal to most it was to me im proud i saw everything through and gave things my best shot i will feel better the next time and be more prepared with what to say in the event they want to come home with me its just not something i think i could handle on a first date

this is my redefining for the term “whitelighting” it can be understood as a form of interaction where an individual uses positive manipulation techniques to help someone who is experiencing anger stress or anxiety unlike “gaslighting” which is generally recognized as a harmful form of manipulation aimed at creating doubt in someone’s perception of reality “whitelighting” appears to be aimed at achieving a positive outcome — reducing stress and anxiety in another person

"how do you talk to people  this sounds so dumb i know it sounds so so so dumb ridiculously dumb

but how do you talk to people 

every time that im in a conversations my mind just goes completely blank if i get asked something i genuinely have no answer no words nothing even if i know the answer in that moment where i need to say it i suddenly dont know it anymore it isnt there im just blank  
no matter how simple the answerquestion or who im talking to i could be talking to my closest friend if i had one i could be talking to my mum if i havent already got a response mentally planned prepared and rehearsed then i dont have one at all 

i want to cry i dont know what to do im happy enough not to talk but most normal functioning humans expect you to have something to say at some point or another if you dont then they think that youre extremely ruse antisocial or that you dont want anything to do with them i like people i dont want them to hate me and i definitely dont want them to think that i hate them but i just dont know what to say

and i dont know what to do about it are there speaking classes where people teach you how to communicate is it a confidence issue its not that i have the words and that im afraid to say them its that they arent there at all when im in any kind of social setting the words simply do not exist i have a lot of trauma and had a troubled childhood ive recently experienced heavy grief and many losses but i dont even see the reason to seek the attention of a counsellor i know that as soon as im sat before them ill have absolutely nothing to say 

im terrified im so lonely i have no friends im unable to form real relationships with people im going to end up all alone i honestly only have my mum i need to find a job soon and i know that ill be horrendous in every interview that has the misfortune of hosting me i can only image the horror that i have yet to experience i really need to overcome this but i have no idea how someone please someone help me i just dont know what to do im located innear london uk if thats relevant at all

i have been nothing but supportive i remind him to take his meds give him his space when he has a bad day and needs to stay in bed listen to him cry make excuses to our kids when hes unwell but im getting tired im the only active participant in their lives right now and im losing patience this has been going on for years and only getting worse im scared hes going to lose his job and then well be royally fed  

i want to tell him to suck it up i want to tell him to just sit at his desk and collect his paycheck and come home its not a difficult or demanding job more than anything i want to go back in time and focus on my career instead of his because if i was the one collecting the big money i could handle it he cant

stress can adversely affect the genetic makeup in your body the mind can positively or negatively affect dna  


  
luckily we have one of the fastest and easiest to feel method to counteract stress that we can benefit from learning how to activate  


  
its present when the natural reaction that our physical body has during euphoric goosebumps whether from listening to a song you really like thinking about a lover watching a moving movie scene striving feeling thankful praising god praying etc   


  
really consider this fact from just being exposed to certain positive thoughts or stimuli your whole  body or just in certain locations for now can experience that blissful wave thats present with chills  


  
now consider how beneficial it would be if you learned how to truly induce that feel good occurrence at will you could definitely use it to counteract overwhelming stress  


  
if you take time to notice you will find that your self induced positive chills have an accompanying sort of feelgood wave underneath your skin sometimes cold and other times hot after researching what that specific current underneath the skin is i came across a sort of energy that is considered our life force

  
this energy has been acknowledged in many cultures and documented under many names like ruah spiritual energy bioelectricity life force prana chi qi orgone rapture tension aura euphoria ecstasy mana vayus asmr nen intent tummo odic force kriyas pitī frisson secret fire the tingles ondemand quickening voluntary piloerection aether chills spiritual chills  


  
if you would like to know how to take control of that feelgood occurrence and how to at will stop the paralyzing feeling of stress on its track  here are three written tutorials on how to really tap into this

"the start of the journey  
so i have cardiophobia and recently decided to take charge of my mental health and try to get back to a good place and hopefully get back in the gym

so i started all this with having myriad gene testing to see what medications would or wouldn’t work for me i’ve taken lexapro for maybe 5 years while waiting for the results my psychiatrist and i decided to try zoloft i was having horrible reactions to the zoloft and after about 9 days taking it i was ordered to stop that was about a week ago now i got my gene testing back 

both lexapro and zoloft were indicated as having severe gene drug interaction for all i knew they were just making things worse all those years taking lexapro and it was possibly slowly just making it worse so after much discussion with my doctor i have decided that for the next 4 weeks until my next appointment i am going to not take any medications besides my emergency anxiety medications and that’s just vistiril benadryl without the antihistamines 

i’ve never really gone through withdrawal before of the medication but so far it’s rough headaches brain zaps nausea some dizziness today’s better than yesterday at least today i also managed to ride an exercise bike for 30 minutes get my heart pumping and not have a panic attack or get anxiety it’s a start it’s a slow start but still i have to be proud of me any other time i would be crying or in full “oh god i’m having a heart attack” mode but i’m not 

could the lexapro really have made things that much worse over the years i don’t know but the fact i was able to work out today and that i’m dealing with these symptoms and not having anxiety about them tells me that i’m a lot stronger than i thought i was

i’m not gonna lose hope i still have a long road in front of me",1

"im sick of it and need a change i  dont explicitly  say i want to kill myself in this post just that i hate my life or have the feeling id rather be dead

x200b

ive struggled to manage both a job and my personal life for close to a decade now i have just come to that conclusion i wake up in the morning and think id d rather be dead and yes a lot of the time i get through the day and im relieved and i think okay maybe i overreacted but no i feel this pretty persistently that id rather not live this life and id rather not feel the way i feel every dayas of last week i got a notice from my landlord they did an inspection nwhxuh im certain i didnt receive 24 hr notice for i think they may have put it in someon elses mailbox who then put it in mine the day of becuase i was checking my mail and i didnt see until i got home from work the day of the inspection from sept to dec of last year i cleaned my apartment less and less and less til i was eventually not cleaning at all or minimally so as to keep things just barely functional 

anyway i had started cleaning but at the time they did the inspection i was only about 14 way on progress and they served me a notice to say they would seek legal action if i didnt get it clean by next tuesdayi can do it and im going to try my best if im being honest i dont think it was as bad as it looked it actually got messier as i was cleaning because i was making piles and took all my spoiled food out of the refrigerator

this is the lowest of lows on top of being close to being diabetic now and becoming overweight

what bothers me is that ive been seeing a psychotherapist for a year and a half now and yes some things improved but yet i sunk into this funk anyway and i cant figure out how i could say to my therapist for four months that i havent been cleaning and i dont like it but i dont feel anything about it and she not flag thst as some kind of mental health crisisidk she just keeps trying to therapy me into somehow not hating my life which is comprised of a 9 to 5 that depresses me and ive hated every 9 to 5 eventually even if i liked it at first  or that  shouldnt feel like utter shit that i have 40000 in debt instead of the 200000 i could have saved well bravo now i know how to not have shame or beat myself up im growing leaps and bounds i still feel like shit every morning

ive done everything youre supposed to do ive done all the diets and ive had those years where i worked out consistently but in all that there was always one thing one trigger my job i was always doing all that or not doing all that so i could offset the way i feltim also seeing a psychologist who thinks i have adhd okay so great maybe after spending thousands of dollars for this diagnosis i get another pill to takei feel like the problem is the 9 to 5 i have no problem working i can work all day long but i really wish i was doing something that didnt make me feel like i hate my life yes it is anxiety but its also that i find the job far too stressful for meive been trying over the years to develop other options for myself but im too exhausted and down to really maintain anything but i know thst i quit my job in 2020 it was the happiest that i was and i dropped 20lbs without trying

to be clear im a good worker my superiors are encouraging me to become a supervisor and eventually get into management i just honestly do not care i dont believe i have to work a 9 to 5 to put eat and have somewhere to put my head but i feel stuck

the point of this post though is to say that im sick of constantly feeling im being largely ignored or minimized saying these things to medical professionals either being given pills or that i should get more sleep or being given tips to avoid spiralling well i didnt spiral for four months but i also just stopped feeling anything or caring about anythingi think i should have been on disability a long time ago but its like its normal to everyone to be miserable

 now things are worse at my job where im doing my own work and training others as well as reviewing and approving their work and im working long hoursi think the 9 to 5 is harming a lot of people and i just think society thinks pills are the answer to everything i tell my np that im working with to lose weight and just prescribes me contrave okay so ill just take this potentially damaging medication the rest of my life just so i can not placate myself with food   work this job and keep my life in order when i would do it just fine if i wasnt stuck professionally

no one has the answers for me if i want to leave my job no one can tell me how to do that or what to do i get that but i just wish someone could say you appear to have difficulty working and managing your life and maybe you might want to consider career alternatives

"need help regarding dental work anxiety  i used to be normal most of my life but due to excessive bullying at school that was all day every day for years i developed panic disorder it hit right after i graduated and it was horrible i thought i had beat it but it would keep randomly coming back and each time was harder and harder to beat eventually i finally reached a point where i was normal again 

anyways most recently about a year ago i went to the dentist for my yearly checkup he told me that i had a big cavity in the 3rd molar on the bottom of my mouth and it had been developing for a year or two i regret not asking him but i was very confused on how they didn’t catch it in the x rays since during that time i was still going in for my yearly checkups anyways he tells me i need a root canal to fix it so i agreed to have it done 

i have never had dental anxiety even when i was struggling with my panic disorder aside from being scared of the gas and being put to sleep anyways i regret not asking about the procedure because i had never had a nerve block before it numbed half my whole mouth and it took me by surprise had i seen it coming i probably wouldn’t have had too much of an issue but since it took me by surprise and i was worried it would numb my whole mouth it freaked me out i just had a small panic attack and was shaking in the chair 

i was actually fine after but unfortunately i began to experience the constant panic disorder again it turns out that dental experience traumatized me somehow so when i go in the waiting room i’m all nervous and it’s like i can’t control it very well i want to just force myself to sit in the chair to have it done but i’m worried about if i’ll be able to control my anxiety or not cut back to now and i’ve recovered mentally also it’s been about a year and a half the tooth isn’t infected to where it’s leaking pus but due to it being broken it has some kind of small infection my head was feeling weird over the year and half but this week it’s feeling even worse i’m scared because i’ve heard you can die from a tooth infection and i’m worried i waited too long 

i have been looking for dentists but for some reason it’s very difficult to find a dentist who will just pull out my tooth with normal numbing and not a nerve block i was trying to think of solutions but my only breakthrough is that there are traveling dentists who will go to your house to do procedures they do it for nursing homes but i was wondering if i pay them if they would be willing to come to my house because that would help a lot with the anticipation and anxiety i experience at the normal dentist sorry for the rant it’s just i’m running out of ideas and any help is greatly appreciated thank you ",1

i feel like im in a car foot on the pedal people pushing the back and yet im going nowhere and thats because the parking brake in on and im the only one that can take it off yet i just cant bring myself to do it

"my life isnt just a flaming trainwreck its a flaming trainwreck that flew off a cliff and is lying smashed and broken at the bottom of a gorge as deep as the mariana trench as it is i sincerely doubt anyone here could top how much of a hopeless failurefuckup that i most unfortunately turned out to be in my case im 32 and nothing seems to have gone right for me im also a highschool dropout and i have no work history beyond being briefly employed at a local video store for a few weeks back in 2007 since then ive been isolated indoors as a friendless hermit for 15 years while rotting away in a codependent death spiral with my horribly narcissistic and deeply depressed mother ive fantasized about suicide nearly every day for the past 10 years and my only regret is that i didnt kill myself back when i was still a teenager or died some other such way before i had to endure these many many years of mentalemotional agony 

to summarize i have no career no friends no skills no money no significant other and no hope for a decent future at all if anything itll be one hell of a dismal miracle if i can manage to somehow avoid splattering my brains on the ceiling with a shotgun if nothing else and as bad as you feel your life might be at least you can take solace in not being me 

for a bit of contrast heres some positives about myself first of all over the past 2 years i managed to lose 70 pounds and am currently 169 pounds at 5 10 that puts me in the normal category for ones bmi although id still like to lose an additional 10 pounds its all especially noteworthy given that my mother and i live together and how she herself is quite obese and eats very poorly in other words its like trying to maintain sobriety while living with a severe alcoholic i also do light exercises when i can am very cleanly and most paradoxically of all am actually in possession of some pretty decent social skills which of course i almost never have the opportunity to use additionally ive never smoked never done drugs outside of some light and very brief experimentation with marijuana as a means to mitigate my depression which itself only resulted in panicanxiety and ive never so much as consumed a single drop of alcohol  

none of that is enough to stop me from wishing i was dead every moment of the day but  still it seemed worth mentioning anyway i suppose truth be told i feel like im finally nearing the end of whatever all this even was my entire existence has been nothing other than an excruciating hell and the amount of trauma im carrying is beyond either proper description or repair the damage and the scars are all thats left and i just it want to be over and done with already i just want to be free of this prison of flesh and misery that ive been trapped in my whole misbegotten life i just want it to end genuinely deeply and with massive amounts of resignation i am simply fucking done with all this",1

"what in the world happened to my husband as a result of binge drinking alcohol  my husband is a recovering alcoholic with anxiety depression he is emotionally avoidant and was raised by a narcissist he is not a narcissist himself but when stress anxiety and insecurities pile up he can have some ugly qualities 

before my husbands drinking became an issue we were able to have difficult conversations and he was able to shoulder stress like any average adult  one day a shift happened he started having anxiety attacks was fearful of driving intense cases of the hiccups and consistent vomiting due to anxiety all this new fear led to coping by binge drinking

the drinking happened frequently and privately i did not keep alcohol in the house i would never find an empty bottle but several breathalyzers a dui and some blackouts later the evidence of a bottle wasn’t needed

in the light of a new day he would confess to drinking a half to a full pint of vodka all at once he did this on an off for 6 years at its worst it happened several times a week then transitioned into once every three months at least

i am happy to say he has been sober over a year he attended rehab and several outpatient programs but he still has all that unresolved anxiety and trauma  what i really want to know is why when sober he used to be ok under pressure nothing great but he kept it together and could get through the motions now why does he sometimes try to unzip the baby out of her onesie from the foot up without considering he cannot get it over her head he is generally considerate in the bathroom but he stumbles as if drinking and has no coordination when using the bathroom in this state his right eye also gets heavy and lazy he drops his body into bed and passes out without any regard to put on his cpap he smooshes food into his mouth like just pushing pizza in there and over dipping chips in queso to drop it all over the floor m when asked to wipe it up because he isn’t aware of the mess he is making instead of grabbing a napkin he got down on all fours looked at the carpet and claimed he didn’t see anything it’s like all common sense and capabilities leaves his body

he gets a glossy bug eyed look to his eyes he has trouble articulating a thought answering questions directly and sometimes will forget things he just said or did or claims he said or did things he did not do

during all that he’s not drunk i’ve done breathalyzers and sometimes you can bring him back down to earth enough to have a slightly productive conversation but most days he just passes out as if drunk is unresponsive and impossible to wake up if you need him as if blacked out it’s absolutely emotional shut down but what medically is happening to him how does he lose all cognition under stress

i have tried everything when i was very young my mom suggested i turned to god i’d pray every single night and i wish i could say it helped for a while i would just start filling my life with distraction up until the moment i slept like texting or keeping the tv on until i feel asleep that then caused me to wake up in the middle of the night and have these thoughts instead i don’t know what was worse

i started looking into philosophy finding the peace of the moment in stoicism finding the meaning in existentialism or trying to find it beautiful that nothing matters in nihilism i read books the last lecture tuesdays with morie a dialogue on personal identity and immortality i hoped that these books would have a thing to teach me since the people in them were dying themselves although i found each book beautiful they did not seem to comfort me by nighttime

"is this anxiety  hi

when i was a kid i was really socially anxious like i would have rather starved than present something in front of the class sing or go somewhere with a big crowd alone i can somehow see how that connected to my childhood traumas

then as a teen i discovered alcohol which at first seemed like a solution but only made things worse while my friends never felt hangxiety i felt sooo anxious after a night out 

but that was not the problem one of the major things that make me believe i suffer from anxiety is that i went to a party a year ago and still worry about wether or not i said something about a certain topic which could now ruin my whole life if i really said it

another time i got drunk and was so afraid i slept with someone the night before despite it being reallyyyyy unlikely like a lot of things i worried about

i see a lot of people describing anxiety as being afraid of social interactions or anxious of having an illness i don’t really have those struggles

do i have anxiety or am i just worrying rationally",1
"my boss cut my shifts hi i’m relatively new here and i’m not sure if i’m even using the right tag or the right sub so i’m really sorry if i’m clogging the wrong space 

i’ll try to keep this as short as possible i work in a retail store that really favours customer service by that i mean one of those shops where as soon as you walk in you’re hammered with ten employees asking if you need any help 

from a customer perspective i usually don’t like being constantly chased around asking if i need a hand i get that it’s the employee’s job but after about four times it gets really frustrating 

as an employee that’s forced to do it it’s even worse i don’t find it too difficult to go up to someone and ask if they need a hand after about 510mins of watching them wander around i also don’t mind if i’m approached by a customer i honestly prefer it it’s my job to help 

if a customer then tells me “i’m all good thanks” then i leave them alone i don’t hammer on about our current sale or tell them about our super secret deals i just tell them “let me know if you need anything” and wander off and go back to what i was doing i don’t want to bother them anymore than i already have 

i was pulled aside about two weeks ago by one of my managers who told me that i wasn’t really a team player in terms of having customers feel welcome when walking in he noticed how i was always hesitant to approach customers and ask if they needed help and at this company it’s basically a nogo

and so he then told me that he’d be cutting my shifts and my pay obviously due to this and how i would only be working certain days so i can improve so now i find it really hard to deal with only 46 hours a week because it’s apparently fair to cut your employees shifts like that especially now considering i’m on uni break for another month 

this isn’t to mention the store is a relatively new company in a new area we only opened back in april we have a lot of people who have never even heard of the store and walk in curiously and as soon as they walk in my coworkers are asking them if they need a hand when the customer doesn’t even know what we sell 

funnily enough i was told there was a woman the other day who left after four different people asked her if she needed anything in my opinion it does more harm than good 

i’ll most likely be searching for another job in the meantime while i stick it out here but i just can’t understand why they would even hire me in the first place if i wasn’t who they were looking for why are workplaces so adamant that they’re here to help you if you’re dealing with mental health issues and then lock you out of work",1

"desperate public speaking some venting it’s getting to the point where it’s controlling my life i have the worst public speaking anxiety probably in the world i’m being 100 serious most people say how they are “oh so nervous to present” but they still get through it only their voice was “so shaky” and their “palms were so sweaty oh it’s the worst”

guys if i so much as think about getting up to talk in front of my peers in my classroom i am fully convinced i will die when i tell you my heart races beats out of my chest my mind is searching for every and any possible way to get out i’ve made some crazy excuses these past 5 years it’s exhausting i have so many other responsibilities in my life and this amplifies everything else’s difficulty by 10x it’s unsustainable it’s horrible guys i know people in life have it worse than i do in illness loss of loved ones etc but i suffer every day because of this and have for the past 5 years i’ve made it this long without having to present by getting out of everything everything my time is running thin i’m going to have to present in the next year or two here now with classes being in person again

i’m a college athlete and my doctor is unsure if i should take propranolol a beta blocker but i want to as it could reduce my athletic performance but i was only going to take it periodically when i need it so when the drug wears off i don’t see how it would affect me the next day at practice or in a game

if i could move past this issue i would literally feel as if the world is mine it has made me feel subhuman inside for the past 5 years and i am fucking sick of it guys i dread every day leading up to any sort of potential scenario where i may have to speak anywhere i do any and everything in my daily life each day to increase my likelihood of avoiding it i’m sitting here at home over summer literally shaking thinking about when that first day of class comes or when my coach makes us introduce eachother to the entire team even just typing that previous sentence was like a gut punch and a ball drop in my stomach just the meer thought of the pure terror i am going to face again every single day guys i can’t do this anymore it’s getting to be too much i need a solution otherwise i might literally lose my mind this has been the catalyst to so many other issues in my life nobody understands why i “move” the way i do it’s all catered around being able to avoid speaking so i can live to see another day

i had a horrible traumatizing experience as you can imagine while in 11th grade and it’s haunted me ever since the irony of it all is i used to be a great public speaker before this now it is the death of me propranolol is my last hope please can you guys give me success stories with my level of anxiety it feels like there is not a chance this can work life would actually be good again feels impossible it’s nothing but suffering and i’ve just accepted it",1
"i feel like i won’t be able to handle a job exactly what it says i just graduated with an honestly kind of useless art degree and i’m struggling with what to do now i try to picture myself working a regular job like retail food service office but i start to panic at the thought of having to socialize and deal with other people whether they be coworkers or customers 

i have a lot of anxiety about pretty much everything especially anything social i’m diagnosed with generalizedsocial anxiety depression and ocd with a potential for others as well but i stopped therapy before taking about those more i live at home and my mother has been trying to help me but it always boils down to “just go do it” i’ve tried explaining to her that i can’t and that her nonstop insistence is only making it more difficult likely pathological demand avoidance undiagnosed so she stopped for twofive days i have poor time awareness so i’m not sure how long exactly before coming back to me saying that she waited long enough 

this has been a bit of a recurring theme through my journey of dealing with my mental illness and finding out who i actually am and the boundaries i am comfortable with she will give a sympathetic “speech” about how she understands what i am going through but they always end with “just go do the thing you’ll be fine” not helpful i know i could theoretically do the thing but that doesn’t stop the panic and anxiety i get from just thinking about it 

i understand that i am a burden to my parents living off of them while contributing very little but i also feel very trapped in this situation i feel that they have not given me the mental and emotional tools necessary for life i actively try to supplement them but the fear and hopelessness have already taken over in their place being aware of this does not change the situation or my ability to alter it 

i feel that i should also mention some chronic health issues that i’ve been dealing with for several years most symptoms for my whole life that have yet to be successfully diagnosed the most relevant being extreme fatigue no matter the sleep circumstances and joint pains that can happen at any time for any reason or no reason at all 

i feel like i have no skills to do anything i have precious little experience and too many things that i cannot do either physically or mentally that no employer would want to deal with the thought of applying is terrifying the thought of replying to emails it terrifying the thought of interviews is terrifying the thought of messing up is terrifying the thought of going there making connections with new people and having to learn about and socialize with them is terrifying the thought of dealing with taxes is terrifying the thought of getting a workers permit is terrifying most of the time the thought of leaving my house is terrifying 

i would like to sell my yarn work and other crafts but that brings a whole new set of challenges i get to do something i love but it won’t exactly bring in enough to live off of especially at the start i could sell prints of my art but that requires quality possibly professional photography as well as a website and store a company to print them and advertising i could sell my art pieces themselves but that would require giving up my precious works that i have spent dozens to hundreds of hours on 

it all feels like too much no matter which way i look i feel stuck and like nothing is designed to work for me and people like me that feels very solipsistic to say but it’s true at least to an extent i’m sorry this is so long but nothing feels okay and i just need help ",1

"anyone else is fear of death intuition can intuition predict death
i have been experiencing intense death anxiety which is really scaring me i am particularly afraid of the upcoming summer holiday and have a persistent fear that i will die on august 22 whenever i hear about someone passing away i feel an overwhelming sense that i am going to die and i constantly imagine scenes of my grave and everyone mourning these thoughts dominate my mind and i cant seem to escape them

ive also developed a fear of the number 11 often interpreting it as a sign that i am going to die for example if i see the number 11 i immediately think it means i will die i am terrified that i might be manifesting my own death or that i somehow have an intuition about it i dont want to think these thoughts but they control me i try to ignore them but its incredibly difficult sometimes i feel good and think about how irrational my fears are but then the anxiety returns and i start overthinking again

i keep thinking that everything i do is my last for example i worry that this will be the last time i see a film or study a subject these thoughts are overwhelming and make it hard to enjoy anything additionally i often feel physical sensations like my heart falling into my stomach or a sensation in my right chest as if theres water and something floating inside it

whenever i get sick i tell myself that these are symptoms of death and ill die sometimes i feel tingling sensations in my chest that i fear are signs

whenever i remember the past and when i was happy i feel sad and get scared that ill never be happy like how i was because ill be suffering from death anxiety forever when people tell me that my thoughts arent real i dont get convinced i feel my thoughts feelings and brain are stronger than me  i want to get convinced but something is stronger than me and like its telling me thats all in vain u wont get convinced and youll die im scared that im manifesting my death by talking about it i dont want to hear and listen all of that 

i hate the summer season because of the death anxiety i like winter but im keep telling myself that the winter has gone and it was my last winter and ill die in summer or when i packed away the winter clothes and took out the summer ones i felt something said that i wont wear them again and ill die in summer clothes im tired and scared of that i want to feel relaxed when thinking about these stuff
 
whenever i watch a movie i tell myself that if a particular character dies it means ill die too it feels like something else is saying this not me because i try to stop thinking it but i cant i want a solution other than seeing a therapist i want to solve this problem by myself as i was writing this i saw the number 11 on the clock which made me even more anxious why does this happen when i am talking about death

i am really scared of dying during the summer holiday especially on august 22 what if this fear is real how can i know what if i have the ability or grace to know my death in advance when i searched for the meaning of 11 or 111 it said to trust my inner voice and intuition and that i am on the right path does that mean my thoughts about death are real people tell me not to search but even if i dont the idea and the meaning are saved in my mind

also when i am in a car i tell myself that if i see a car with the number 11 it means ill die and when i see it i feel terrified the same happens with the number 22 because im scared to die on august 22 i am scared that this is intuition

moreover when i hear certain words like future next year 2025 summer july august september university etc i feel suddenly scared and feel something in my stomach like my brain is waiting to hear these words just to scare me its as if these words trigger my anxiety even more i need some ways to help me other than seeing a therapist

based on what you’ve read do you think my thoughts are a result of anxiety or are they driven by intuition additionally can intuition actually predict death i need answers for all of my questions 

does anyone have the same problem",1
"how exactly do breathing techniques work one of the most common stress relief techniques i keep hearing over and over again is inhale for x seconds hold your breath for x seconds exhale for x seconds

"romance and anxiety  today i am going to be seeing a therapist in a few hours

i met a girl on bumble who is also attracted to women like i am we have been talking for over a month since april 21st to be exact and have been on over 4 dates i like her a lot and i would say weve been dating for over a month so its not exactly a relationship yet as we are working towards that

so far here are my feelings as best as i can describe

1 she approached me first on bumble dating and at times i feel like because she showed interest first i settled for her i dont know if my feelings are forced genuine or im just desperate
2 in the past ive dated a guy who on the first date i knew the connection wasnt there but i messaged him after the date in hopes of creating something becaus ei was dsperate for a man to talk to and for a boyfreind after a while he stopped messaging back so sometimes i dont know if m really just sticking it out for a while
3 i think at times i tell myself  this will fizzle out because i fear that may happen so i say those things so i can prepare myself for the worst and so that when it comes i dont feel too bad because i saw it coming
4 when we first started knowing each other i asked her a lot of questions we even wrote down questions to ask each other i was so curious of her
5 does anyoene se think im being hard on myself right now
6 she usually gives me so much compliments and attention she tells me i am pretty i am sweet i cant wait to see you soon etc and at times i feel like i am only with her for attention she gives me or maybe my mind convinces me so
7 when anxiety fear and panic are at the back seat and i am calm i really enjoy her company i love sleeping over at her house looking at her face i love her touch i anticipate her callstexts i cant wait to see her when shes picking me up for a date i love waking up next to her but yesterday i woke up in the morning and felt a rush of anxiety from no where suddenly i felt like i lost all of my feelings i felt like such a fraud like i was with her covenience it seems i was creating problems that didnt exist
8 yesterday when i couldnt even think of a few qualities i liked about her i panicked even more i couldnt even remeber moments from our first date it felt like anxiety and fear were clouding my thoughts as i got less anxious after i cried i was able to write a few things down
9 i have factored her in my future at some point ive thought about if we go long distance i dont have the craving to see anyone else i just like her
10 i have established a nice freindship with her where i enjoy her company
11 a part of me feels i am overthinking everything especially for a dating stage that has been going on for a month she feels that i put pressure on myself to know everything now and at times i want to give myself space to just let things grow
12 i am scared to lose her i like her i like her person im so sorry i cant put into words everything i like right now but im sure theres something
13 in the past ive stuck it out with people especialy men when dating because i was lonely during those short situationships ive always known that i didnt really like the person but the idea of having someone deep down i knew but i stayed even when they would try to end things id still want to continue this is the first time that i have felt that things are genuine and real but i cant help thinking im just  convincing myself and sticking it out till things fizzle
14 i like her i just like her i dont feel the warm feelings in my stomach but i like how she looks she is kind gentle i love her touch i love her kisses i love how she pays atttention to the details how she is so soft and warm i love how she is vulnerable how she cares for her family how she takes initiative and plans dates i love car rides with her i love even the things that i dont remember because of how anxious i am
15 when im anxious and fearful i feel no feelings towards her
16 i hate that i can only think of the things she has done for me and how she makes me feel

"the impact of positive partner support on stress relief welcome to listen2ai
listen here 

researchers over at binghamton university stumbled upon some heartwarming findings that reinforce the ageold adage behind every successful person there is a supportive partner we always knew that a little encouragement from our spouses could go a long way but who knew it could actually alter our hormonal stress responses the study focusing on 191 married heterosexual couples found out that not just any support but positive support from our partners could lead to significantly lower levels of cortisol – that pesky stress hormone that likes to make itself known at the most inopportune times

in an endeavor that sounds a bit like eavesdropping researchers observed these couples discuss personal nonmarital issues over two 10minute sessions by scrutinizing these conversations they gauged the levels of support provided and received paying close attention to the nature of that support – whether it was perceived positively or negatively moreover they didn’t just stop at observation they went on to collect saliva samples to measure cortisol levels adding a tangible biological layer to their findings

interestingly the study found that women who perceived the support they received more negatively felt less understood and validated leading to a spike in their cortisol levels on the flip side when partners demonstrated positive support skills – like understanding validating and caring – cortisol levels tended to drop dr richard mattson the lead researcher highlighted the stressamplifying effect of negative receptions of support emphasizing how our perceptions play a crucial role in this dynamic

hayley fivecoat the brains behind this study and now a clinical research psychologist pointed out a critical factor – the cumulative effect of how supportive we perceive our partners to be over time this general perception can drastically shape how we view specific behaviors in the moment suggesting that what we bring into a relationship in terms of expectations can also influence our stress responses

what does this mean for us moving forward well understanding the nuanced interplay between support perception and stress could pave the way for not only stronger relationships but also for healthier individuals it also beckons further research into how diverse couples experience and leverage support the tone versus the content of supportive communications and even how different cortisol measurement techniques might offer new insights into effective partner support

in closing while the study might currently only cover heterosexual married couples its implications stretch far and wide as we understand more about how support dynamics function within relationships were likely to uncover more universally applicable strategies to bolster our collective wellbeing it’s a fascinating glimpse into the biochemistry of love and support and a reminder that sometimes the best stress relief comes not from a pill but from a partner’s affirming words or a listening ear

"nausea and appetite loss to just give a short background ive generally been an anxious person for most of my life its not until recently that it has been noticeably and physically affecting me 

for the past 5 days perhaps i began feeling nauseous out of nowhere i can barely stomach food even when i know im hungry its feeling hungry but not hungry at the same time and its almost torture i ate half of a cookie for dinner the other day thats all i could stomach 

at first i thought i had a disease or medical condition because these symptoms dropped out of nowhere it then began to occur to me that im probably just severely stressed even though my body has never experienced this level of symptoms before

the cause unfortunately probably my new job and thats not changing anytime soon the fact that i work there for the summer and how awful it is i dont even know where to start to treat everything trying to just change my mindset isnt just going to magically fix everything wish it was as easy as being positive and believing in yourself yadda yadda

to deal with the resulting discomfort i then throw myself into more work or try to argue myself into not doing more or to find clarity which results only in overthinking cycles wasting time and mental energy and burnout  
  
it could be due to being indecisive i dont know how to draw clarity in defining enough because any target or goal feels arbitrary and i usually have it in me to be able to push through and do more i end up just working or overthinking usually overthinking myself to exhaustion  
  
ig im trying to be perfect  or even if not then being maximally effective and making sure everything im doing is right and gathered right too  
  
i cannot change my mode of action unless i feel safe in knowing that i am doing what is rationally correct or right",1
"bad memory caused by stress 

does someone have short memory lose or super bad memory when they are extremely stressed

i have been forgetting everything lately but it feels horrible because i am a teacher overworked and i need a good memory

this is the second time its happening to me the first one was when my best friend started declining in health and later on passed away
after he left us i felt my good memory coming back but lately its really trash

flu like symptoms from stress ive been down bad since yesterday afternoon with flu type symptoms  my level of stress and anxiety from work is the highest its ever been and i honestly think i got sick as a result of that  i was reading that high levels of stress and anxiety can cause flu symptomshas anyone else ever experienced this,1
"ad cause of mystery nausea i 37 f have been constantly nauseated yes 247 for almost two years now and intermittently prior to that with only the occasional relief and that relief is simply when my body decides its nothing i have done ‍♀️ i also suffer from major fatigue brain fog low mood impending doom mentality memory loss little to no libido hair loss occasional heart palpitations a history of panic attacks thankfully havent had one in a long time low appetite i used to enjoy meal planning for my family  eating but now both are a chore as my stomach just feels so sick all the freaking time 

ive seen several docs over the years gps gis ents naturopaths applied kinesiology chiropractor and had a gamut of tests done never officially given a diagnosis of anything just ideas of what could be wrong the only things i personally could see that might cause issues is 1 a deficiency in ferritin and a slight deficiency in vitamin d and 2 my thyroid appears to be a bit under active which has thrown off my hormones somewhat i am under the care of a naturopath please no negative comments about pseudoscience she has been the only practitioner out of many who has taken the time to dig deeper and she refuses to give up on methe supplements she has recommended are top quality and yet my body doesnt care it just doesnt want any of it and my sleep suffers and my symptoms worsen when i try them this issue has been going on for many many months digestive enzymes slippery elm probiotics d you name it supplements dont seem to ever help me

so here is my question to you all
has anyone else experienced a constant nausea fatigue etc for 1 year and its all linked to anxiety andor depression 

ive dealing with anxiety since childhood but didnt realize it until my 30s and im convinced i had undiagnosed depression at some point i have done therapy here and there and it was helpful to an extent but it got expensive the idea of meds scare me because of possible side effects i am just starting to wonder if my symptoms are actually all due to anxiety since no doctor has been able to find an underlying cause yet id appreciate hearing your experiences ❤️‍",1
"could use some help in helping my wife with her anxiety so my wife has a lot of anxiety issues and its really doing a number on the life of her myself our kids and our relationship

the worst offender is her tendency to always see things in the absolute worst possible light the living room is a little messy so its beyond all rescue and shows what a horrible person she is or our son spends too much time playing video games so he will be permanently socially crippled by it and itll be her fault etc then she feels bad because she feels bad and how that is a burden for me which further shows what a shitty person she is and so on

im not sure how to help i myself am pretty adept at thinking rationally and positively and not blowing things out of proportion but trying to share my view is a pretty weak comfort in the end its simply not how things are in her mind i get that just being there doesnt much help either saying everything will be fine is just hollow 

  
in addition to that shes got diagnosed myalgic encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome possibly due to covid so shes got limited amounts of energy to actually make concerted efforts towards learning new ways to think of things obviously i dont have unlimited energy to deal with this either so i want to make my efforts count

so what do i do shes got plenty of doctor support and meds but it just isnt cutting it maybe the meds help smooth out the worst patches but its far from enough i really want to help but nothing seems to help much whats the best short termaborting a breakdown and long term things i can do to help ",1

"how art can help manage stress and improve mental wellbeing hey everyone

ive recently made a post here introducing an article about using art as therapy 

i believe that art can offer both creative expression and psychological healing as it allows you to express emotions nonverbally and can be very calming and meditative

"xanax and anxiety how do you all feel about xanax and taking it for your anxiety   
  
i was prescribed xanax 5 mg in january to take once a day as needed for panic and anxiety  
ive made that bottle last because im terrified of benzos if i do take a xanax will sometimes cut the pill in half and only take 2h mg for instance

my partner has been encouraging me to try to rely on the xanax a bit more like take it before certain triggers i can foresee so that i dont have a panic attack and to take it during a panic attack ofc

tbh the benzos do really help i feel there have been times where its completely turned a panic attack around 180 i can tell if ive taken one when i dont really need it because the affect isnt so much clearheadedness as it is an unpleasant grogginess that i really dont like the feeling of essentially i dont feel like it feels good to take a xanax outside of the times i need it but when i do take it when i need it it helps a lot

i guess theres also a sort of guilt about it i feel like i should learn to deal with my panic attacksanxiety attacks on my own and not become dependent on a quick fix my partner begs to differ and that my brain is like a sprained ankle and its okay to give it a break rather than allowing it to hurt itself more in anguish 

what are your thoughts on this how do you all treat benzos in your care toolkit

note i only took a xanax once when i wasnt having a panic attack perse because i was hoping it would help me with some nausea and gi issues im also experiencing from chronic stressanxiety it didnt work so i didnt try again",1

how to deal with knowledge without getting depressed many people say that the truth is liberating i do not disagree but as a slave when you get rid of ideologies and laws that have always been imposed you find yourself in an eternal void uncomprehensible loneliness everything that once made sense now is garbage today for example i cant anymore watch a movie to relax i cant talk to talk when nothing makes so much sense life gradually also loses its meaning together i try to look for people who suffer from it but its like looking for a grain of sand in a distant galaxy today people prefer to be slaves because the suffering of breaking the chains is unknown the one who opens his mind to a new idea will never be the same it is impossible to go back to be the boy who laughed at everything but today i try to find a new reason in this world,1

at first i thought it could just be my period and it would go away but it isn’t

"what i dislike about the united states hi everyone lets discuss what are your thoughts  comments  solutions to the items listed below

 crime is not dealt with effectively and crime rates continue to rise

 people feel more unsafe

 high rates of economic inequality between social classes

 many big important things are becoming increasingly unaffordable housing food toiletries
 largest social class middle class shrinking
 government allows big corporations to price out potential home buyers further decreasing middle class opportunity at building wealth and generational wealth
 government allows food and toiletry companies to collude and set their prices for essential items

 k12  higher education quality has decreased and become more expensive

 makes it more difficult for people to obtain an education and opportunities for upward social mobility
 bogus and increasingly irrelevant degrees offered
 people leaving college with debt that they are having a difficult time of paying off

 salary and wages not keeping up with today’s economy

 healthcare too expensive and extremely inflated

 few mental health treatment facilities for the mentally ill
 people struggling to pay for the care they need and might avoid going to the doctor further increasing an overall health decline

 drug epidemic  demand for drugs

 problems with drug smuggling from other countries
 not enough accountability for people involved in the creation and sale of drugs including pharmaceutical companies

 corporations have too much power and influence in government

 lobbying is not effectively regulated
 products are designed for sales not for the consumer wellbeing

 too much of a safety net for lowincome people

 government not providing enough incentive for people to get off of welfare
 not enough safety net programs for the working class people who need help

 unaffordable childcare significantly caused by increased government regulation

 people are less likely to put their children in day care and not work to babysit instead

 overall feeling that the american dream is over and there are less opportunities to build wealth

 overall attitude that everyone is for themselves

 lack of ethics

"my mom keeps critiquing every little insignificant thing about me and it’s getting on my nerves what should i do so my mother has this obsession with appearance if one minute thing is wrong with me she feels the need to correct it and lecture me about it no matter how small it is

for example if my hair isn’t combed in the way she wants it she tells me to fix it even though it looks barely different from how it looked originally and if i wear jeans without needing to unzip or open the button even if i end up perfectly wearing them she gets angry at me for not doing it her way

this has happening ever since i was kid and at first i was okay with it since she was teaching me proper etiquette but nowadays it’s starting to get irritating because like the two examples i mentioned these are very insignificant things that are barley noticeable

just last week she felt the need to lecture me about the way i walk which i should mention this was in the morning and i just woke up early for college and i was still half asleep also in other scenarios where she critiques me about my walking this is after i have just been in an airplane or a car  nd my legs have been in one position for a long period time and have just woken up

it also feels very degrading to me that she feels the need to critique every little thing about me like i can’t go five seconds of minding my own business without her having to correct something about me which is barely noticeable in the first place which is why it’s stressing me

when i confront her about this she’ll just say “i’m doing this because i love you” or “what will other people think they’ll think you’re weird” even though any normal person would hardly care about this she doesn’t seem to understand my point of view and this just irritates me even more

that sums up my problem what should i do",1

"on my way to rock bottom and don’t know what to do my 26m anxiety and depression have completely taken over my life and i’m barreling toward rock bottom in a lot of ways i feel like i’m already there i’ve always dealt with anxiety ever since i was a child but the last 2 years have been absolutely brutal and it’s only getting worse

i started having horrible panic attacks shortly after my 24th birthday my vision would get blurry i’d get bad tunnel vision feel faint and just felt terrible this could last 10 minutes or i could have multiple chain together which could last hours these attacks completely drain me of all energy afterward completely ruining the rest of my day i was having these attacks nearly every day and sometimes i’d go a few weeks without having them although the baseline anxiety was still present but then they’d come back with a vengeance

then about a month ago i started having awful globus sensation at first i was convinced my throat was closing up and i was going to die im not entirely sure if this is gerd related or anxiety related or both but regardless it’s drastically exacerbating my anxiety it’s gotten to a point where i’m scared to eat much of anything especially hot food since i had an incident around 4 months ago where i burned my throat by accident eating hot food but when i do eat i take tiny bites and chew my food until it’s essentially a paste and after i eat it the globus can get worse or come back which just makes my anxiety worse my mother mentioned to me the other day that i look like i’ve lost weight and it’s because i barely eat anything now i’m 5’3” 180lbs last i checked so it’s probably a good thing i’m losing weight but the reasoning as to why i’m losing that weight isn’t good

all of this is just awful my anxiety and depression have completely taken over and i have to rely on others for nearly everything i live alone but i can’t even go to the grocery store for myself because my anxiety gets out of hand in public i’m too afraid to drive myself anywhere out of fear i’ll have a panic attack while driving i can’t even work i had my literal dream job and i had to quit because my anxiety and depression were so bad that i couldn’t work and of course losing that job just made everything worse i have no income and have to rely on my parents to keep me afloat which i feel absolutely awful about and eventually if i don’t get this figured out it’ll get to a point where they’re not able to help me anymore and i’ll end up becoming homeless officially hitting rock bottom it’s just a matter of time

my therapist that i’ve been seeing for over a year now doesn’t seem to know what to do to help either at this point i’m more of an analytical person meaning i’m more of a math person than let’s say a literature person and i feel like that makes grasping mental health aspects difficult for me what i mean by that is i always try and use logic and reasoning to calm myself down when i’m anxious but my anxiety inherently rejects logic and reasoning i find it very difficult to use logic to get myself out of a thought or mental situation that my brain didn’t logically get itself into i don’t know if that’s the best way to explain it but it’s the best way for me to understand

i’ve been prescribed wellbutrin for depression and clonazepam for anxiety but i have horrible anxiety about medicine i’m not anti medicine or anything but it terrifies me especially mental health related medications when i was a child my aunt took one dose of strattera when it was new and it killed her the next day it was due to a combination of her having these specific types of tumors and having recently taken a mao i think that’s what it was due to this experience i’ve developed a fear of medications even though i know what happened to her will most likely not happen to me so i struggle with taking them and thus haven’t started taking the wellbutrin or clonazepam even though it’s basically been a year since they were prescribed i’m just terrified that it’ll make things worse somehow

i just don’t know what to do i try getting fresh air i try to do things that’ll help but i have no motivation to do anything anymore it’s awful it’s not living i feel like i’m in the drivers seat but i don’t have the wheel i want to do things but my anxiety and depression don’t allow it i’m just so done with everything and feel like i’m just waiting to run out the clock",1

"everytime panicanxiety is approaching it is an opportunity to teach your body that its not dangerous when something triggers your body and it starts freaking out just feel it accept it and know that its not dangerous look at it as an opportunity to heal rather than something bad to be avoided you then program your body to understand that there is no danger for if there were actual danger then surely the mind would act as if there were danger also when the mind acts as if all is well even though the body is freaking out then the body will eventually calm down and learn that all is well

dont try and distract yoursel or hide from the triggers that only signals to your body that there is actual danger dont react respond all is well you will recover this is the process it may take some time but it works honestly just live your life like normal and you will eventually recover probably without even noticing until youre already well again

also i want to add that for me yoga meditation and exercise escpecially outdoors helps me a lot i also think that a keto or zerocarb diet can help a lot to calm down the body im also going to try out some calming nootropics although i dont think its at all nessecary maybe itll speed up my recovery and help with sleep also some sort of reinforcment that your symptoms are actually only because of anxiety and not something else is super helpful for me",1

"made mistakes at work due to burnout and unclear expectations and i am having a breakdown basically i worked a research job at a hospital this summer and transitioned to part time work through school i’m in my last year of a bachelor of science school got really hard and i’m trying to go to med school and started to get really burnt out and anxious i had no discussions about parttime work expectations prior to the semester other than i was supposed to work 10 hours a week i always got a lot of flexibility and independence at work so i put some projects on the back burner and assumed it would be okay as it often was 

however my boss pulled me aside today and told me that my work for the last 4 months has not been satisfactory that i’ve let the team down and that he could fire me if he wanted to i know that i wasn’t firing on all cylinders but i had no idea that i was falling so short of the mark i don’t know why he waited 4 months instead of telling me when the problems started and now i feel like a huge fuck up  i’m freaking out and i don’t know how to go to work moving forward without having a panic attack any advice is appreciated",1

"stress is how i live my life and i think it’s taking a toll on my body sick all the time how do i get by i think a combination of work master classes low financial income high bills chronic asthma and birth control causing  constant bleeding is making me sick all the timei also have low vitamins d so that doesn’t help

i don’t know what to do anymore i am 28 and i honestly feel so much older my body just doesn’t know how to function at a normal level anymore i can feel myself breaking down i know everyone has stress in their life so i’m not trying to say my stress is more than others…i just feel like i have a particular combination of negatives that is really driving me down…

i don’t know how to alleviate my stress… i love my job i absolutely wouldn’t change it for anything but it is very demanding mentally i am getting my masters in the field to progress in the field and have some  financial success as well  however i’m constantly being expose to germs and clearly my body can’t handle it

i had so many snow days last week and as soon as i go back to work just for two days i get sneezed on …peed on coughed on etc… now i’m sick

right now this year i made maybe 1520k… and it’s not like i don’t have bills i do so much so that i have racked up 10k in credit cards just to get by…

i know i should crack down on some going out to eat and going out with friends but these things are what offer the few moments of relief i have from the grind and it’s hard to give it up i have already starting using an app to track my spending…

my masters classes are going well but also cause me an insane amount of stress

i have dealt with asthma since childhood as an adult tried steroids but couldn’t afford them anymore that helped alleviate my use of the pump but i still have at least one attack a month 

i have tried several bc methods and other than a cyst on my ovaries have no other reason to be bleeding heavily… i would go back for another sonogram but i can’t financially afford it right now the last one cost me 700 even after insurance i can’t just stop the bc because i want that extra measure of protection but my body seems to suffer from this right now i’ve been bleeding for a month straight and heavy with so much pain

you know how in life there are steps you can take to alleviate stress… i don’t feel like i have anyway to alleviate mine i can’t talk to anyone…or at least not anyone too much before they’ll stop listening or worry about their one stress and not have time for mine…

i can’t seem to find more immediate ways to alleviate my stress other then thinking about my future career that will at least financially alleviate some stress but that still about a year or more away

what are some of your ways you alleviate stress",1

ok so quick backstory 
april 2020 during the covid pandemic my wife and i took a drive to the houmas house plantation in south louisiana for an adventure everything was mostly shut down so traffic in and out of baton rouge didn’t exist so we took advantage of it and went exploring as much as possible we  are walking the property and get to the main house looking through the windows i notice a harp next to a piano i immediately get an intense rush of dizziness and anxiety out of absolutely nowhere thought it was strange and it eventually went away as we continued our self guided tour 

here we are 4 years later and since that day every single time i have seen a harp or thought about one which only happens when i tell this story i get the same rush of lightheadedness followed by a very light anxiety attack it makes my chest pound like crazy lol  this includes right now as i type this out 

my 4yr old autistic son loves classical music so i have some jon williams videos on this morning for him to watch and harps keep popping up i figured i’d ask here and hope this is the right subreddit lol i grew up playing guitar bass and drums and have always been around various musical instruments including harps  i’ve never had any crazy harp accidents or incidents so i’m lost as to why this started so randomly and hasn’t stopped maybe i’m subconsciously terrified of harps lmao i have no clue  

i’ve tried googling this many times with no luck has anybody else had any experience with anything like this or can somebody please explain why i feel this way at the sight and thought this one particular musical instrument

hiv exposure how to move on 2 months ago i had an exposure  this was my first sexual encounter in my life and she is a transwoman sexworker she gave me a blowjob i didnt bring a condom with me because i thought it is just a blowjob but she insist on putting the condom before blowjob so  she bj me with a condom on after that  out of nowhere i had this sudden fear of catching hiv from this encounter i ended up on reddit and google looking for symptoms  hiv tests  stories from other ppl all made my anxiety worse and i decided i need to get a test so post exposure 4 week i did a 4th gen hiv rapid test at home and the result was negative i was temporarily relieved at that time but when i go back to internet some say 45 days post exposure  4th gen lab test is considered conlcusive my anxiety got worse waiting for the 6th week and i went to a clinic on post exposure 41th day and did the test  it was again negative i was relieved and then again my mind was like  bro you tested on 41th day not 45   i know 4 days difference is not gonna change my result but these voices in my mind asked me to do a test after 45 days i even asked my dr if i need to test again  he said the test result wont change and its very unnecessary despite listening to the dr i still insist on testing and i went on the 50th day post exposure this time  my dr was quite annoyed and said dont ever do test again for hiv if this comes out negative and yes he was right  the result i got on the 50th day post exposure was negative too so i know its conclusive as it is 4th gen blood test from vein and i was happy and relieved i went on internet and reddit again checking how accurate this tests are and apparently there are some guys out there talking about delayed seroconversion and the need to test again at 3 month post exposure i read from experts dr hunter and dr hook and my personal dr said delayed seroconversion is a myth and my results are already conlcusive but still why do i have this fear of contracting hiv even tho i already got my results i have done 4 tests in total and all of them are 4th gen  every test shows im negative but still my mind tells me what if the condom has tiny holes that let blood pass thorugh or maybe sexworker used an expired condom and i didnt notice it what if there was blood from the sexworkers mouth and entered through my bloodstream via the foreskin as i am uncircumcised and even worse  my mind started to doubt my dr and the lab like what if they didnt run the test properly could my dr being careless about my situation isnt he serious enough  i want to get out from this anxiety  i actually uninstalled reddit but somehow whenever my mind thinks of possibilities of contracting hiv  i end up again in reddit and google looking for answers and reassurances so  my question is  are my results already conclusive should i again get another test done how do i get out from this fear of contracting hiv even after i have done tested all this time,1

i used to fool myself into believing that i was good hiding my struggles from others
since finding a great therapist i have become more aware of the signs prior to slipping into a dark place even more jarring for me is the awareness that others saw them before i did this has led me to develop  new anxiety where i am constantly worried that others have picked up on the clues before me and are now judging me

 hey guys

a bit of history about my case  ive been on the antidepressants for about 3 years now

ive had anxiety all my life and ive been on multiple prescriptions from different psychiatrists

the thing i want help with and wish to ask people  ive noticed a pattern in myself with the antidepressants that it stops working for me after 2 months

ive talked about this with my psychiatrist before and he says my body is somehow resisting change

additionally he made me do a genetic test done where you find out about what drugs youre respondent to to which youre not and the amusing part was that i came to respondent to the drugs i was taking but yet again after 2 months  my symptoms started to surface again and it stopped working for me

i can write about what meds i have been on in these 3 years but ive had a mix of medicines from india and the uk as i struggled to get appointments people would know if youre from the uk or europe of how painful it is to get appointments even if youre dying with anxiety

another thing i would like to point out and risk here ive tried cocaine twice in parties now no im not an addict just did it twice and it actually helped with my anxiety and be more of who i am  i was literally in a zone where i could have gone to work as well and be normal functioning human being as when i get down by anxiety which is 247  i get a fever cloudiness irregular heartbeat breathlessness and more

"virus making me anxious hey there

i had top surgery nearly 8 weeks ago and it’s healed really well i obviously had some healing anxieties which mainly revolved around making sure my scar was healing fine and keeping myself as healthy as possible will all the right foods etc

i had a tiny complication that while it sorted itself out and healed in a matter of days set off a terrible spiral of health anxiety in me which has manifested itself quite badly thinking that the physical symptoms i was feeling was a sign that something else was wrong with my healing i went to the doctor who reassured me that i was okay and it did seem to help me a bit

as of about 13 days ago i came down with a virus and as you can imagine that has set off the anxiety again because low and behold one of my fears came true  getting sick i have already been to the doctor several times about it since as i have a lot of sinusitis symptoms including post nasal drip and an irritated throat which has been stopping me from swallowing properly and also making me super aware of my breathing while eating plus over the last few days i’ve been vomiting as well as it sets of my gag reflex

i suppose what i’m asking is how do you separate feelings of anxiety with the genuine symptoms of a physical illness i’m living with my parents atm so i’m being well looked after but i feel like my illness has made me fear eating solid foods because of the swallowing and that i’m going to choke or something if i do i don’t want to make myself malnourished by keep vomiting and not being able to eat enough of the right things but tbh from what i can see on this sr is that people have been suffering with far worse for far longer than me idk any thoughts appreciated",1
"my anxiety has gotten worse over the years should i start considering medication i’ve been wondering this on and off since high school but now as a 29 yo i’m starting to think i should take it more seriously i’m legit sitting on the floor waiting for a response from my boss over something i goofed on that actually isn’t a big deal and is easily overcomable i know it’s not a word but i can barely think straight atm and my head is buzzing and my eyes are feeling this way they do when i’m stressed and anxious whenever i think i’ve fucked up on something i begin spiraling that i’m a bad person or their trust in me is ruined and any credibility i have as an employee is ruined and i can’t be trusted with anything and that’s just what i’m talking about at the moment my anxiety also has me overthinking way too much about silly little things like going to concerts arriving five minutes late etc

when i google when to consider medication the responses are generally “when your anxiety hinders your ability to function in society” but since i still go to work and try my best and whatnot i never considered myself hindered just constantly anxious i might’ve been having minor anxiety attacks nearly every day for the last few years but i never noticed because i thought that was regular anxiety  ",1

my doctors response—
hopefully you will read this message after you got some sleep  im not sure how to explain what is going on  of course you can stop the fluoxetine lower to 10mg or power through with the 20mg and plan on side effect resolving  i will send rx for fluoxetine 10mg and an rx for quetiapine to take at night to help with sleep  i assume you are not smoking weed constantly

 no i am not smoking weed i did about a week ago but i am not a regular user i am going to stop the medication i think for a couple weeks to get back to as “normal” as possible if i do decide to start the prozac again after i reach a baseline i will start at 10mg thank you

week 36 450mg

although it stabalised me i’m still feeling really i’ll with horrid side effects water retention weight gain brain fog clumsy etc

just wondered if anyone has had a similar experience it just feels like i’m the only person in the world with this problem but surely someone else has

don’t get me wrong i’m not sitting here saying that everyday i feel depressed or unhappy but around 80 of the time it feels like i just can’t find a happiness or peace i constantly have a feeling of anger loneliness or just being very nonchalant and i don’t know why 

also with those feelings comes just the feeling of either wanting to yell cry or just hit something luckily i feel i’ve found a positive way to cope with these feelings as that’s one of the perks of being a firefighter we get to break stuff down lol but all jokes aside i just don’t know what to do anymorei feel like i can’t talk to anyone and it’s to the point where i’m feeling everyone would be happier if i wasn’t around… ",1
"when would you shout im an emotional wreck for me even some trivial things can make me shout imanemotionalwreck

 those moments when the bus leaves right in front of me while im rushing in the morning

"therapy  support or buisness disclaimer  its essential to note that my perspective may not be accurate i seek clarification

therapists both psychiatrists and psychologists provide affirmations and profit from their services my psychiatrist asserted that i possess high intellect leading to dependence due to our inclination for positive reinforcement repeated interactions result in financial gains for therapists some may overdiagnose prescribe medications offer counseling and earn income they are aware of our desire for validation whether truthful or not ultimately they are professionals managing business transactions do you agree and if not why",1

"question about upping gabapentin okay so i am on 3x 800 mg a day for about a year i have gotten to where i am having horrible tolerance withdrawal with anxiety and intrusive thoughts and shaking 

this always happens between my first and second dose of the day i take my first dose early in the morning and barely feel it then it gets worse intkl 5pm when i take my second dose then it starts wearing off about 8pm i am going to ask my doctor to go up since the max dose is 3600 i know its bad but i cant handle this anxiety anymore

my question is my friend knew my problem and gave me 3 300mg capsules and 7 800mg tablets can i start by just increasing my dose by a 300mg capsule over 3 days and then halfing the 800mg ones to increase by 400mg until my doctor ups my dosage this is miserable in between doses and will i have any adverse effects by going up like this or since its capsules instead of tablets

i know i shouldnt do this but this is miserable will this work for the time being until my doctor can up the dose and then i am going to start a taper once i get stable and get my mind back anyone on higher doses than 2400mg and had to go up did it work i am mainly just scared of taking the capsules and tablets together will my body think its foreign and reject it sorry for posting on this board it just wont let me post on the gabapentin forum please advice i am in misery between doses also when should i add this dose to my daily intake like at what time of day ",1
"help with changing jobs and overcoming the complete fear of getting into something new hi everyone this is a hard post to write but ill just write it out in the hope that i might get some advice that i can use

ive been in my job now for around 15 years i started out at entry level in it and over the years i was given opportunities to step into new roles and try new things each one scared me but i had a supportive manager and that helped me after about 3 years or so the team grew from around 5 of us to around 12 and we formed an amazing team everyone was nice and helpful and it gave me confidence to try new things again i moved into a network engineering role and thats what ive been doing since ive now reached the ceiling of my pay scale and the only next move in our company would be to move into management and im not really interested in that the amazing team i talked about have long moved on and im the only one that remains with all new people

so the simple answer i suppose is to just get a new job this would give me new opportunities and it would also make me grow as a person but im so scared i have an anxiety disorder and the thought of going into a completely new environment is just too much for me ive been stuck now for about 5 years just kind of treading water in my role ive still had opportunities to learn new things and ive done that but i do feel like getting something new would be good for me  not just for the money aspect i know in the long run it will help me deal with things better

the reason im looking for a change is because i dont really like the environment i work in any more and feel like i could become more specialized if i went somewhere else there are definitely things i like about my job like working from home occasionally and i dont have anyone on my back to micro manage me im trusted to do my job and i get on with everyone

but i remain stuck im good in interviews i like talking to people and ive been offered several jobs over the years in other companies but i always end up backing out and staying where im at because it just becomes to much for me

the main fear for me i think is 1 the new environment and not knowing anyone or the job 2 new responsibilities which are scary and 3 the fear or feeling so overwhelmed with worry and becoming dizzy and feeling sick that i wont even be able to focus on what im doing

the things that helped me get to where im at which i feel is a good achievement all things considered is that i moved up and into where im at slowly as the years rolled by i slowly added things to my role and learnt new skills and i worry about going into something else at this level with the same amount of stuff to know i worry about my skills and now knowing enough in it to know what im doing

i know that the only way ill know is by doing it but i just hate that i have to quit my job in order to find out i worry about not coping and then im out of a job and then id have to find something else

so my question is what can i do to make it easier for me to get into a new job and a new company i think a smaller team would help me going in to meet a team of 6 or 7 vs a workforce of 25 would make quite a difference i think",1
"anxiety feeling crippling crippling work and social anxiety help

33f and long story short i had a shittt child hood i don’t like to talk about it because i was told everyone has a story i grew up in foster care adopted by a family friend who treated me like crap and was abusive ended back in foster care as a kid bounced around for years and then was out of my own from very young have countless post traumatic stress situations i can recall that have caused me such panic and trauma more to the story but you get the jisp

my entire life has been fight or flight i have battled anxiety and depression more so anxiety in my adult hood my anxiety has gone through stages but over the past 57 years my anxiety has been taken a bad turn every single year getting worse 

i went from having panic attacks every now and then to having them daily 

i managed to go to college get a degree work my way up in corporate make a great living for myself have a husband and a dog and a beautiful home and life together

but my anxiety has gotten to a point for me that it feels crippling i have constant worry about the future as in minor things worried about a meeting i have at work what will people think when i say something did i say something wrong i go over a conversation or an email over and over again for weeks upon weeks it’s sickening constantly worrying about how i came off if i sounded stupid

i have a hard time paying attention often frantic about these things all day that i started to make mistakes in work over the last few years and some of these mistakes still haunt me i’m constantly second guessing every little tiny thing i do for work this goes on socially as well with people that are acquaintances or my in law family

 i cut back on drinking to barely nothing i mean like once or twice a year because the anxiety is so bad afterword i found it not to be worth it to drink 

my work anxiety though is by far the worst i 100 battle with imposter syndrome and part of it is i can remember things people have said that have made me feel stupid over the years that of course traces back to my insecurities from childhood of always feeling like i wasn’t smart kids made fun of me in school because i never knew the answer when i got called on but in school i was worrying about having a place to live and not school 

then in work i can recall times of people making me feel stupid for not knowing something something that doesn’t even pertain to work one guy asked me years ago do i  know what iq stood for i said no i don’t actually then he put me down for not knowing this and laughed at me this was at work i asked my friend who i think is one of the smart people in my life if she knew what it stood for and she didn’t but things like this live on with me forever like i said probably traced back to my childhood i go over situations like this in my head countless times my confidence is in the drain it causes me panics throughout my day and some days i feel crippled in bed or hard to start my day because i’m constantly worried that i’m not cut out for work

i have been in therapy for years i just moved and have the opportunity to try a different type of therapy for anxiety called emdr and hoping that helps 

idk i’m looking for advice anything anyone else experience this anyone else actually overcome anxiety i have googled so many things to help read other stories read books tried therapy and countless medications i feel stuck and sometimes feel like this can’t be it there has to be something that can really help atleast i hope so hell",1
"how to stop twirling hair for many years ive had the habit of twirling my hair – when im tired when im focusing on something or when im pondering something complex or joyless i believe the reason is internal tension that i dont know how to control or change i cant walk with my hair down or even with part of it loose even with a ponytail – because my hand immediately reaches for my hair and i start twirling it my hair is currently slightly below my shoulders and id like to grow it long but my only option is to completely gather all my hair into a hairstyle so that nothing hangs loose or cut it short

15 was the worst age for me in my whole lifetime  hey guys today i just wanna talk about this trash age for me in my whole lifetime this year was sucks for me it made my anxiety even grow and grow ok so on my 15th birthday it was quite normal got a new ps5 game called final fantasy 14 which is a mmorpg where you can play with tons of players and the story is just insanely long but very funny and interesting i entered high school a bit after my birthday and it was just a fine 1st semester made some new friends and got along with the most of the teachers my schoolmates were very kind friendly and also funny we had a great time in the 1st semester but after this someone’s reaction to a joke of mine turns into a living hell or even a dreadful curse ok in my break in school i was going to a cram school to do my homework but on break time there i talked with one lady there and i couldn’t remember the joke but i remember it was surely not a hurtful or a bad joke but the lady reacted quite strange and she started getting angry at me and i was soo surprised and shocked from that day on the curse just kept on coming in my side school even began quite strange where some of my classmates started avoiding me or acting strange around me got into trouble everyday i was even scolded from the school janitor because i was making an art project in class that only had like 2 hours and since there was a lot of people in the room i was very uncomfortable and anxious and couldn’t finish it so i had to finish my art assignment by being left in school late and the art teacher gave me the permission to stay school until i finish it but when i walked the hallway alone to get my shoes so i can go home quickly after the art project is done i encountered the school janitor and was yelled by staying late at school there were other kids but he only yelled at me just turns out like this once i’m alone i feel scared walking alone in school well i wasn’t able to talk back to the janitor cause if i do i’ll probably get painful consequences so i just kept quiet and made him yell as much as he wants so at least i won’t be in big trouble after that i attend to a therapist house it’s his house but at the middle of 10th grade i started going there every mondays and wednesdays you are able to talk to the counselor he has his friends when he was a kid so there were like 65  70 years olds but i got along with everyone there too his friends are also his classmates when he was little there were even some university students attending there and we had a lot of fun at his house my counselors house was huge and one of the rooms offers his costumers candies and cookies in a huge bowl so we ate a lot and talking at the same time i talked with my counselor that people easily get on me and say ridiculous stuffs i also got treated like a baby from some 16 years olds due to being one of the youngest in the class the age 15 was a completely garbage for me i’ll kill myself if i had to return to this idiotic age i remember i was completely embarrassed walking in the streets with this age the number is a lame the year of this age is very stressful lots of conflict with your parents just trash go to hell 15 years old you’re a curse i was very happy on my 16th birthday that i was able to leave this lame age i even learned a japanese word where number 1 is “ichi” and number 5 is “go” and some japanese kids calls the number 15 as “ichigo” means strawberry lol just too embarrassed to be this age,1

"do you find yourself constantly worrying this helped me ⬇︎ do you find yourself constantly worrying

  
youre not alone  

  
i used to be trapped in a cycle of negative thoughts  

  
constant worry    
• stole my joy   
• ruined my sleep   
• drained my energy   
• started my anxiety   
• affected my wellbeing    
but a simple habit changed my life 

   
but first i want you to understand why we worry so much 

   
in our brain a small almondshaped part called the amygdala helps us process fear  

  
think of it as your brains alarm system  

  
its job is to keep you safe  

  
the problem is its biased towards negativity  

  
psychologists discovered some shocking odds in experiments conducted at the university of california berkeley 

   
9 to 1  

  
thats the odds that our brains notice negative versus positive things  

lets think about that again  we take in as many as 9 pieces of negative information for every positive one that gets through  

  
youd bet on a horse every time with those odds    
but when we meditate or practice slow breathing activity in our amygdala reduces    


professionals believe that this occurs due to the “hyperpolarization” of neurons which makes them harder to excite    


literally calming your mind    
here’s a simple and effective breathing practice to quiet your negative mind    


i like this technique because you can do it anywhere    


• close your mouth   
• breathe through your nose    


place your tongue on the roof of your mouth behind your top teeth    


• inhale for 56 secs   
• exhale for 56 secs    


start with 5 mins and work your way up to 20 mins a day    


breathe and break free from the chains of worry

anyone with heart rate anxiety  hi guys i’m in my 20’s and developed some heart rate anxiety due to getting diagnosed with pots 2 years ago well anxiety is sort of an understatement it’s full on panic attacks with pots your heart rate can sore and go really fast because of this i fear my heart rate going so high that maybe it wont come back down i’ve gotten checked out multiple times and they say my heart is structurally healthy but that still doesn’t put me at ease especially when i am having a panic attack and it sores close to the 200’s that scares the crap out of me it’s like a never ending loop it’s gotten so bad to the point of me not being able to be alone out of fear of something happening to me when no one is around it has put a damper on me and i see how stressed my family is when they try to make accommodations for me to never be alone i just feel so lost and am wondering if anyone can relate to me i’m young and should be out having an independent life like i used to this lifestyle has caused depression as well because i don’t hangout with any of my friends i don’t go out and have me time i just follow people around like a puppy i’m losing my sense of self ,1

pausible ways that help manage stress im 18 ive been told i get stressed pretty easily even about simple things to be honest im just realizing how often this happens because i really didnt noticed or was conscious about it its not doing me any good as expected and i want to stop worrying and stressing too much about the smallest things i want to know if theres any way method anything that helps to control or reduce this tendency if its okay to refer at it like that i never heard an actually good advice for anxiety or stress because it all reduces to just dont stress yourself so much its not that big of a deal and indeed most of the times its not a big deal but im sick of hearing that because i genuinely cant help but feel anxious even if its something managable or fixable im currently in therapy to get help with this and because ive picked my skin for a long time probably caused by the stress im not seeing much results yet because ive just started but i really would like to know if someone else had experienced something similar have any advice or maybe we could help each other i just want to hear something constructive from someone with experience for once and that its not going to invalidate how i feel thanks and sorry if its not very clear english is my second language     ,1

"saved my dogs life but my body wont calm downim so angry by how little control i have over my anxiety the lack of solutions bothers me immensely  so ive got the whole cocktail of issues and then some  
  
adhd  im taking adderall  
anxiety  depression  
hormonal disorder hypogonadism  
intestinal issues  
poor as all heck lol



before my medications making me a full human being i basically didnt feel my emotions between the hormone deficiency and adhdrepressed depressioni just disassociated from everything

now that i feel everything i kinda wish i could go back to just being numb and only kinda miserable

my dog was dying like legit we were convinced it was over me and my mom were holding her and calling vets to put her down 

but i managed to spend many hours researching while crying myself halftodeath during the hours before dawn i basically didnt sleep that whole night

and it worked i figured out how to save her

i figured out and started feeding her smaller portions of shredded chicken multiple times per day in order to heavily relieve the stomach blockage the tumor causes butmy dog is old and she has a growing tumor in her belly

i almost feel like ive made a proverbial deal with the devil

like ive put off her death a few weeksmonths maybe which is amazingbut ive also made her eventual actual death much worse because her tumor is just gonna keep getting bigger and maybe spreading



i so badly wish i could make myself feel normal again its seriously messing with my me and my life and while i have support that doesnt help me with the roiling ocean of anxious pain and fear twisting inside my guts

i just want to be happy i saved her and to make my stupid brainbody stop making me suffer like this for no reason

i use an app called welltory to measure my stress levels heart variability heart rate and other things these things can all be measured with you heart beat 

my stats have been horrible for months meditation music and breathing with help a bit for a short time 

well i recent started icing my chest and its a legit game changer  my stress that would be at 90 or higher has been reduced to 2045 my resting heart rate that would be high near 100 bpm had been brought down to 70 to 80 bpm overall coherence is much better and my energy levels skyrocketed

"for those feeling helpless  theres hope my story is one of miracles redemption of life and freedom  im writing this post in hopes that i can help those of you who are struggling

im a 40yearold male with a history of cptsd chronic depression suicidality anxiety addiction and 6 concussions  for most of my life i suffered 

however today i am free of all of these  im sharing my story today in hopes it can help bring hope to those of you who are feeling lost defeated and desperate

ive been engaged of some form of psychotherapy since i was 13  while the traditional methodologies helped me calm the intensities of my emotions they fell short of liberating me from my distress  

everything in my life was impacted  my ability to create and maintain healthy relationships was nonexistent  i sought alcohol and drugs to escape the torment i was in  

i had never seen what a healthy relationship looked like i didnt believe in love  to me love equated to pain and fighting  

i felt alone and was constantly fighting for my sovereignty

in my 33rd year the tides started to shift  over the past 7 years through blessing after blessing ive been able to free myself  

the transformation ive been through was predicated on learning practices and commitments

inspired by what i experienced i sought to reverse engineer what worked for me and formulate it into a system that could be shared and repeated

even though the past 4 years of my life have been extremely challenging and chalked full of traumatic experiences ive not once fallen back into depression suicidality anxiety or substance abuse 

im so grateful for my freedom from the prison i was in

finally i feel confident in my ability to navigate anything my life throws my way  

now id like to share with others the exact formula that completely resolved my mental health conditions im wondering if anyone here feels like that would be helpful

if there are enough of you who feel it would be valuable to your healing journey id be open to creating the educational materials  

please let me know  

in the meantime bless all your lives  im praying for all of you who are struggling  keep faith that it can and will get better with the right treatments

my psychiatrist recently recommended i try 510 mg of inderal instead but he told me it is usually used for social anxiety i like the idea of not being knocked out for the rest of the day but i am scared to try it because i am scared that it won’t be strong enough to combat the severe panic attack i get on planes

d3
milk thistle

i also started lorazepam 5 weeks ago and lexapro 9 days ago i also started back on concerta a year and a half ago 

back to the zma5 what i didn’t realize is that 5 is 5htp 5htp and lexapro and concerta can cause serotonin syndrome very dangerous this week each day i started feeling weirder and having odd symptoms very stiff knee stiff feet stiff back headache full body sweating for 48 hours insane amounts of diarrhea and body agitation felt like my nerves where shaking  low and behold mildtomiddle level symptoms of serotonin syndrome it’s deadly if not treated i decided to just discontinue use of 5htp lexapro for a few days until i can talk to my doctor and take lorazepam because they use it to prevent seizure and relax the agitation if i went to er i also took a warm bath and drank a ton of water to hydrate up started feeling better within a 30 mins from the lorazepam taking sunday off from lexapro and concerta until i can talk to my doctor to see how i should proceed 

i feel lucky that i read up on various interactions that my supplements and meds can have hopefully i’m out of the woods but be warned

"a rant about healthcare tw sexual assault and trypanophobia so i just went to the doctor for my physical the rant is mostly about how every doctor ever begs me to get blood work which i get because ive never done it like i 100 understand it is super important to get bloodwork done but what frustrates me to no end is that i have severe trypanophobia and there are no options for people like me you just have to go to a crowded room with stations where they are drawing blood i cant do that 

i exposure therapyed myself so i was able to get the covid vaccines i drugged myself into oblivion to get the flu shot  where i proceeded to freak out and sob but i did it then i got my super overdue tetanus shot and both covid vaccines and by the second covid shot i didnt need drugs anymore since then ive gotten all the covid vaccines and flu shots sober that is a huge accomplishment but also all of these vaccines were in private rooms or near private where i could tell the person i was scared and they hid the needles etc 

my trypanophobia i think is directly related to veins i hate veins bruises cuts and so the idea of a vaccine possibly going through layers of skin and fat and veins is the horrifying part to me not the pain for example tb tests dont bother me as much because its under the skin i can watch people get tattoos because its not so deep but when it comes to blood draws that is for a fact going into your vein and then harvesting your blood and then you get a bruise which i hate and then you might pass out which i also have a massive fear of and i just hate everything about it tying your arm to make the vein pop out everything 

so how am i expected to just go get my lab work done it doesnt work like that are there no options for people like me no private rooms or drugs i can take

and she tells me to get my lab works done as if she is talking me the sky is blue while giving me a last minute pap smear which is triggering to me because i was rped so its just all too much and i just needed to vent to people who understand i vented to my mom and all she said was get your labs done and yes i have a therapist

"im stressed regarding trump and scotus its bad enough that the supreme court is aiding and abetting trump in ensuring he gets the delay he wants with the election interference trial which could consequently lead to trump winning the election and our democracy coming to an end  whats worse though is that its possible that even the three liberals on scotus sotomayor kagan and jackson not only voted in favor of hearing the immunity case but even voted to not hear the case until late april  i mean its one thing if trump becomes president again and we lose our democracy but if this ends up happening because even the liberal justices on scotus were aiding trump that would make things so much worse because i mean if justices sotomayor kagan and jackson voted to hear the immunity case and to hold off on hearing it until late april then they would have betrayed us and our democracy big time  because of this i am trying every single avenue to find out how the three liberal justices voted when it came to whether to hear the immunity case and when arguments on this case should be heard but as of now nothing has worked and its leading me so much stress to the point where im having trouble focusing on my work in regards to my job  what can i do

ps i know that even if the three liberal justices voted against hearing the immunity case or at the very least wanted to hear the immunity case much sooner it doesnt change the fact that we likely wont get a verdict before the election but the other justices on scotus are conservative therefore them aiding and abetting trump with the trial delay is much less surprising",1

"i can’t feel the physical stress response anymore some background i have been through many periods in my life of extreme stress activation and fight mode in terms of anxiety throwing up losing 10 kilos because of not being able to hold down food staying awake for 80 hours because i could not sleep my bpm constantly at 140 etc etc then i have gone into complete shut down and freeze mode due to depression this up and down cycle has basically been my adult life however i healed from the depression by learning to feel and accept my feelings again at that point i hadn’t cried in like 10 years but my last shutdown lasted six months which i spent in bed doing nothing worst part is i wasn’t depressed or anxious or anything i just think i experienced a really bad adhdparalysis

anyways ever since i came out of the last depression and shutdown i don’t feel like i experience a physiological stress reaction ever i have been in extremely stressful situations and i’m definitely thinking about these things but my body is like “meh” no activation no nothing and ngl it’s nice but i can’t help but feel that a healthy stress which i have not experienced since my teens would have been good for me in terms of my procrastination i have tried googling this and can’t seem to find a similar experience

another peculiar thing is that my grandma’s pituitary gland literally disappeared into thin air that’s how it was described to me she used to have it and now she doesn’t they could never figure out what happened to it and this gland in the brain activates the production of cortisol the stress hormone now it’s probably completely unrelated and i know nothing about hormones and such but i thought i’d mention it can too little cortisol do this to your stress response or will it have the opposite effect",1

"morning anxiety ugh soooothe second i wake up in the morning i get this thoughttrain where im ruminating about one very traumatic event after another with each thought in the train comes a jolt of anxietyjuice which makes me panic even more

its kind of like i start thinking about a deceased friend or loved one ruminate on that for awhile and then start thinking about some horrible thing i read in the news or some huge bill i have to pay or random thoughts like what if i went outside and got attacked by a grizzly bear

"fear of shapes tryphobia taking over my life ever since i was a kid  like way before the days of the internet so nobody can say its a placebo effect

i was terrified seeing on tv when you see a time lapse of flowers or plants growing quickly

i read a newspaper article about somebody sticking a load of razor blades in a wall  and the thought of it made me sick this was early 1990s

anything to do with anything sticking out of a hole that shouldnt be there like spikes totally creeps me out

very similar to tryphobia  anything that looks abnormal  or honeycomb with lots of circles close together freaks me out terrifies me makes my skin crawl and i cant get the image out of my head for the rest of the day

due to my disabilities i use the internet a lot and many people use clickbait shorts of tryphobia grotesque clickbait thumbnails as their youtube videos under seemingly innocent tags like asmr and beauty

the channels never get deleted or they come back the same day youtube does nothing about it im told to just click and report  when the mental damage is done

my phobia is so bad that here in the uk they have some statues full of blunted knives that were handed into the police  its supposed to be a good thing  but to me seeing a figure made out of knives makes me feel absolutly sick





my phobia is so bad i cant even play some video games because anything like traps with spikes makes me feel sick  some characters looking like tree trunks or with multiple heads makes me feel sick

i just cant carry on living like this  sometimes i look even at my cats scratching post and when its super scratched and looks mangled the fabric on the post in my mind i just feel sick seeing the weird patterns

it isnt normal to have this kind of a reaction to 50 per cent of normal every day things  and i dont know what to do at this point

im even worried to start a tryphobia thread because im scared of people attaching photos in the related replies yes sickos literally who say its not a real phobia make videos to harrass and trigger you

this phobia is making my life unberable to be honest its making me not even be able to watch youtube anymore or read newspaper articles and to have to be careful when i look at objects in the real world

i dont know what to do at this point would medication even help this extreme phobia

thanks for any replies and please dont include images of triggering things",1

"my mom cares more about my grades than my mental health i’m on the last year of high school and in my country there is this major national exam happening at the end of the year every honor students want the top scores for this exam and that includes me however even after prepping so hard emotionally and physically before i couldn’t find any motivation to go on anymore even tho it’s so close to ending i’m nearly there yet i’m just so tired and burnt out

i lost grip of my academics but it wasn’t entirely my fault that i was ranked lower than expected the exams were so much harder people above me were all cheating so that would explain how i would end up below

i talked to my mom cried and ranted and all i wanted was comfort and understanding maybe a bit of hope  words of advice but all she could say to me was that i’m a disappointment and if i don’t rank among the top she would disown me 

that made me feel so much lesser i rarely opened my problems to anyone especially a close family member because we don’t often talk about how we feel 

i’m currently just at lost i’m crying nonstop and i’m just at a dead end i’m burnt out i’m tired i’m trying my best i lost sleep and everyday i wished i was dead i even tried harming myself i wished i was a better person

"my experience with the anxiety cycle  hey all going on about 4 years with anxiety and i think typing this is helping me put together my entire experience i hope it helps someone else

my anxiety kicked in literally out of nowhere about four years ago it happened in college  one day i realized that i was freaked out about attending classes going to the gym and going places with my friends and i had no idea why

i thought it was nerves i talked to my parents friends and everyone basically told me to suck it up and that it happens to everyone it made my life hell i started missing classes due to feeling nauseous feverish you name it  shit that wasnt even due to an underlying illness

i started to avoid the things that i needed to do i stopped working out and taking care of myself and instead started playing video games almost exclusively during the day i stopped showing up for medical appointments terrified that i had some disease that i was dying from sounds like health anxiety huh i just never wanted any medical bad news ever

i did nothing for four years as it got worse and worse  jump forward to 2023 and i finally saw a therapist the diagnosis you guessed it generalized anxiety and depression still figuring out the exact cause but so far i dont think there is any

basically my cycle goes like this

1 an event that i am uncertain about  nervous about  dont like occurs or appears

2 i start manifesting symptoms of some illness  nausea headache toothache dizziness lump in throat you name it or i get sick with a real virus and i do the same thing anyway

3 i diagnose myself lump in my throat yeah ive got hypothyroidism random jaw ache i have a tooth abcess that i cant see yep that easy

4 refuse to go to the doctor because i dont want them to run tests and tell me bad news

5 use the diagnosis as a way to get out of things or further seclude myself

6 repeat

i went from a healthy welladjusted human being into an anxietyridden person with panic attacks strange symptoms and horrible depression

so i did the only thing i could i started changing i started taking better care of myself even when it sucked i started scheduling appointments again and meeting people did i feel like shit yes did i have panic attacks yes have i been to the er in the past year for a panic attack disguised as a heart attack yes but im a hell of a lot better than i was last year and thats good enough for me im medically healthy   my residual blood tests ekgs and mri scans will confirm this  thats my ammunition against my anxiety

the bottom line  
if your cycle sounds like mine please i am begging you stop diagnosing yourself not only are you going to empower your potential health anxiety but youre also going to add another layer of anxiety

stop looking at symptoms stop trying to figure the anxiety out because at the end of the day its not rational it doesnt work like a virus or a bacteria you cant cure it with antibiotics and a good nights sleep

talk to a doctor talk to your loved ones tell them how you feel but ultimately its up to you to come to terms with the fact that anxiety does not control you it doesnt rule your life i wish i knew that four years ago but ill be forever thankful that i know it now

ill reply to as many people as i can in hopes that i can help others in my predicament i believe that we can find strength together thanks",1

"starting anxiety meds for the first time ever…side effects hello everyone this is my 23f first post here it’s been a very long time coming but i finally agreed to start anxiety meds sertraline 25mg after being diagnosed with ptsd in 2016 after a very bad accident i tried to cope with my feelings through therapy and a good support system though that has been great i recognize now that i need a little extra help 

i started taking my medicine last night around 6pm but then i read it’s better to take in the morning so i took one this morning around 815am i will begin to take it in the mornings from now on 

i was wondering about side effects of the medicine today i’m feeling very drowsy and kind of brain foggy like i’m slightly buzzed but still alert i was fine at work other than nausea but just felt sort of weird i was also nauseous and took some medicine for that are these side effects of the medicine and if so how long do they last or is this the medicine itself my doctor said to give it a week and see how i do on it but i don’t want to feel like this every day

"struggling with anxiety more now than ever even though life is better now why and how to overcome  so i was diagnosed with anxiety and low mood when i was 15 that developed into anxiety depression and panic disorder within following years later from the age of 18 to recently a lot of traumatic experiences have happened both to me and to family members that should’ve broke me but i stayed strong despite my diagnosis at 15 and struggling with these things from a very young age but just not getting help until i was old enough to take myself to the doctor i have always been able to push it aside and am known to be an extremely confident and bubbly person people know me as friendly before they’ve even met me as i’m quite popular as well as very strong i handling situations i’ve been to two universities for my undergrad and masters and am 23 now all the traumatic events that occurred one after the other or some simultaneously occurred between the ages of 1823 pretty much from the time i left home to go to university to me moving back i left a very unhealthy relationship with a controlling partner in march of this year and still went to all the grad job interviews that were scheduled for a few days after the breakup to prove to myself that i was good enough for them despite him always telling me i wasn’t that being said i got offered the jobs from all three i applied to and they were all offering even higher salaries for the jobs because they wanted me so bad conveniently the best offer was back in my home city which meant i wouldn’t have to spend money on rent and can stay with my family for a while to save up to travel or for my own house 

bottom line is life is looking up now i have all these great new opportunities great friends around me i won’t have to struggle for money due to now being able to save and afford nice things life is “good” so why after 5 years of back to back traumatic events is my anxiety seemingly at its worst 

my first day of work this week for this new job i kept having anxious episodes my anxiety isn’t so much thoughts anymore it’s more purely physical where i seem to start dissociating and feel really faint like i’m going to pass out nausea with hot flushes and extreme panicked feelings even hanging out with friends who i am comfortable around it happens the only place i seem to feel safe now is in my bedroom as it’s the only place these “episodes” don’t happen i went literally to the gym and for a drive thru mcdonald’s today with my friend and it kept happening and he was like are you okay my manager in a meeting thought i was confused because i’m normally so chatty and just went dead silent trying to let the episode pass it’s really scary how it happens in situations i used to thrive in some of which are such normal and mundane things it’s more so triggered by places which i feel i can’t leave eg work because i need to stay until the end of my shift or when i’m out in a car and know it would be really embarrassing to say “i need to leave and go lie on my bed because that’s the only place this isn’t going to happen” but it can happen anywhere outside the house it’s really scaring me and making me feel trapped and like my body is stealing my own freedom 

can anyone give any and all advice on how to stop this from happening and also explain why it’s since these traumatic events have ended that it is now a problem surely it should have been then not now when everything is looking up finally things are looking up and this is making me feel like i’m gonna blow them because my own body is against me sabotaging me from thriving in life now that i’m actually safe and have good things happening i just don’t feel in control of my body and it’s scaring me from going anywhere as i don’t know when it’s going to happen 

i am meant to be going on holiday with my friend next month and i don’t want to ruin it by having these “episodes” over the 5 days we are there that could be far worse being in a new country in a place i obviously can’t escape from to lie in my home bedroom countries away this isn’t me and i hate it i’m the type of person that jumps at the opportunity to enjoy new places and good times i don’t understand what’s happening i don’t want to cancel the holiday but i am terrified

ps i’ve tried ssri’s like 4 different kinds didn’t work for me use beta blockers every few days sometimes they work but sometimes they make me feel weaker also got into debt a while ago trying to pay for my own therapy waiting list is way too long to get it free like a few years so need advice now

ive smoked daily for 8 years with the exception of two tolerance breaks

im right now and have been in a depressiveanxiety spiral this entire year thats been the worst ive ever experienced even though ive had problems with anxiety for a very long time i switched to studies from home in the beginning of the year and alot changed in my personal life with relationships ending etc which has caused me to become a hermit basically and i have been isolating myself alot this year and especially last few months ive previously had issues with selfmedicating benzodiazepines which i fell back on and am right now on a tapering programschedule i also switched antidepressant medication to about 4 weeks ago from a ssri to bupropion 150mg then my doc increased it to 300mg about 1 week ago

i dont feel like weed is helping me anymore ive lost selfcontrol and just smoke all day and study as much as i have the mental energy for when im not ruminating i also feel like i cant tell apartseparate what causes my anxiety and depression issues when theres so much going on at the same time but i feel like weed may be haulting my progress right now i dont know

i think positively of cannabis if you live a healthy life and use it in a healthy way but thats not the case for me right now so i really want to take a break mainly because i want to see how it changes my daily lifeif it improves my mental state but im also afraid of my frail mental state im quite unstable still from changing medications and the tapering benzos part

i guess my question is is it a good idea to quit weed when you already are in a very rough period

1 im not super comfortable with these friends yet theyre super nice and supportive and they understand that i have anxiety but i just dont know them well enough to be fully comfortable what if i have an anxiety attack and have to worry about how i look in front of them
2 its going to be really hot and i know i wont feel good i prefer the cold and sometimes my anxiety is triggered by the heat

road test is making me so stressed i live in canada and i got my class 5 road test soon apparently the test is supposed to be a lot easier than the class 7 getting your n road test but i still can’t stop stressing out over it everyone who’s taken it has told me as long as i don’t make any major mistakes or make too many mistakes then i’ll be fine but i’m worried if i’m too stressed then the stress will make me make a major mistake,1
"med question about a year ago i went to the doctors and explained how i had been feeling anxious and stressed and that id tried talk therapy etc but felt like things werent improving he prescribed me an anti depressant  citalopram and thats when things went bad i took them as prescribed and fell into a whole that can only be described as not giving a shit the anxiety was certainly gone but so was just about every emotion as well as my ability to hold a conversation without disappearing and generally just being a space cadet even around my kids it scared the absolute crap out of me because i didnt feel fit or safe to care for my kids 

ive been off the meds for a little over 6 months but my anxiety is pretty bad  not crippling but constantly there and causing mood swings feelings of overwhelm etc 

im wondering if any of the anti anxiety meds work on anxiety without making me detached from all emotions or being a complete zombie",1

"need advice and support please on changing antidepressant dose my first post but i must say having read many other posts that reddit seems a wonderfully helpful community so thank you in advance

i am suffering from severe situational anxiety and probably some pure o ocd and ptsd im doing all the usual lifestyle changes plus therapy and cbt etc im on 30mg mirtazapine and was on 10mg escitalopramlexapro and moved up to 20mg 7 days ago on my doctors advice

10mg seemed to take the edge off and stop the worse of the anxiety attacks getting through but still left me with some milder attacks and some anxiety intrusive thoughts and rumination hence moving to 20mg after 9 weeks on 10mg

the problem is that since changing dose my anxiety levels and attacks are basically as bad as they were unmedicated im struggling to function i have some diazapamvalium to help my im trying to minimise using it

for those of you that have increased your ssri dose did you find it made your anxiety or depression and other side effects return and most importantly how long did it last for

i really need to know this will get better and hopefully in not too much longer life is currently very difficult

thanks",1
"scared i triggered something need advice please ugh i’ve been avoiding posting this on reddit since yesterday cause it’s embarassing

i know a lot of people do it but i don’t know posting it on the internet seemed weird to me oh well here i go i need answers

i got my holter monitor results a couple of days ago everything came back mostly normal except 188bpm during an argument with my manager which was seen as “inappropriate “ and not “abnormal” by my cardiologist since i’m 19 and my bpm can technically get to 200bpm which to me 188 should be close enough to be considered concerning but that’s a different story

he also said there was nothing electrically wrong with my heart which prompted me to think everything was okay and i’m just experiencing anxiety 

anyways since then i’ve had minimal palps some flutters some skipped beats but once a day at most for about a week

i started masturbating again because of this i thought i was okay by what my cardiologist said

the first few times nothing happened no symptoms no palps did it for abt 4 days straight with this 

the last time i did it my heart was pumping hard and skipped a beat i stupidly kept going though once i was finished again nothing

i was laying down feeling sort of anxious then i felt a huge flutter then fast hr after which i never felt before after a flutter

of course this sent me into a panic and ive been anxious and having flutters and extra beats since

this prompted me to schedule a stress test friday with my cardiologist since he said to do so if the palps keep happening

i just wanted to know if i should be worried abt this or if i couldve triggered something

rather be embarassed than be in a worse situation",1
"emetophobia ibs and anxiety make a horrible combination  this is more of a vent im just so frustrated with myself 
backstory i got a serious unknown stomach illness at 8 that landed me in the hospital since then ive had severe emetophobia and health anxiety i cant stand uncertainty 
ive been incredibly stressed these last few years while in college and lately ive developed ibs from it its not too serious but unpleasant i was put on 10 mg of prozac a few months ago and its really helped my stress induced ibs 

but today for whatever reason i got an ibs flare up i havent changed my diet and my stress levels are naturally lower since im out of school i ate the same pasta i usually eat for lunch and had pasta for dinner and had stomach problems after both times just slight cramps and loose bm and my anxiety is through the roof 

the uncertainty is killing me i cant stand it my brain is hyperfixated on finding a reason any reason i cant handle uncertainty my guess is pasta obviously but why is it only bothering me now could it be my absolute worst nightmare food poisoning except i dont feel sick just slightly uncomfortable why why why is this happening surley i should be better because im on prozac im in tears trying to rationalize it but theres no rationalizing it it feels just like an ibs flare up but any changes to my gut send me into a tailspin i feel trapped just as i did when i was 8 i feel this need this burning horrible anxiety ridden need to know why this is happening i cant focus on anything else i think never getting an answer messed me up so badly as a kid i cant stand the anxiety around uncertainty even if its just a random anxietyibs flare up i cant be 100 sure and it drives me nuts 

the worst part is these things feed off of each other if i feel anxious i get stomach cramps then i get more anxious i cant escape this hell 

i just needed to vent ive been doing so well with my anxiety and ibs up until today im trying to remind myself that is meaningful progress and one bad day doesnt negate all of that i just cant stop hyperfixating on the dang pasta and why it would suddenly bother me could it be a greasy pizza i ate 2 days ago is it just pasta what if im dying 

thanks for listening advice and virtual hugs are always appreciated i just needed to vent",1

paxil 80mg
buspar 60mg
olanzapine 75mg
guanfacine 3mg

yes you read that right im taking 2 ssris and clomipramine together wanna know why social anxiety thats why ever since my ocd started my social anxiety has gotten uncontrollable 

every day i live in this pain not knowing if i will ever be able to talk to people like a normal person ive never desired anything more to just talk to people 

no joke ive had over 15 jobs where i walked out on day 1 because the feeling of knowing that i will never hold a normal conversation and never being able to make friends with my coworkers just sends me into deep depression 

my parents dont know what to do with me im not providing income theyre more worried than anything though 

i dont know what to do anymore therapy just doesnt work for me because of how intense my ocd is if something from therapy does end up working my ocd will try to find a loop hole in the exercise so it stops working for me its so annoying 

please does anyone know of a medicine i could try that can help me has anyone tried ridiculous combos that ended up working please i just want to talk to people like a normal person im tired of this im at my breaking point

"going back into a trade… so basically i’m working at a grocery store right now but before this i was doing hvac yep a little over year ago i was climbing under houses going into attics and cutting my skin everyday for 19 an hour 

well… i’m doing it again 

i don’t want to there are just no other decent paying jobs around me so it’s my only option really to be honest though everything i mentioned above is not what i disliked about a trade it’s the learning the stress of slowing down the team the stress of fucking up someone’s house and the constant dread of having to worry about everything again the next day 

i was let go from hvac because it was winter and business slowed down so really i’m left here now stressing on if i’ll be good enough or fast enough

"stressreaction towards nothing relationship related my partner m27 and i f32 went through a rough patch this summer there were not a lot of happy moments and just fighting or silence for a few months he is bad at working through his own emotions so when he is feeling down he will lash out paired with my problem that i want to solve situations and cannot give him space it was just a bad mix so i was super stressed around him and got very careful what to say and where to step a lot of crying and anger inside of me about the situation

skip a few months he has been doing way better and it went upwards and we have been back to the way we used to live together and be there for each other and not as it felt before constantly against each other 
however i cannot get rid of the stress reactions of my body when he is upset about anything i’m immediately in flight or fight mode when his voice gets louder not even against me just for example when something is not working out or he just seems down but doesn’t want to talk i can feel my body tending up my heartbeat hasten and sometimes my eyes just start tearing up i can feel the unrest and uneasiness immediately and it will stay for a while even after the situation in which i’m not even involved is over

it is a reaction that partly made sense when things were bad but now i experience the same stress reactions about nothingvery little

"do you worry you’ll manifest your negative thoughts how do you cope law of attraction i recently discovered that i have some pretty extreme ocd one thing i am currently struggling with is fearing that i am and have in the past manifested negative things happening to myself or loved ones 

certain negative things have happened to me after worrying of said negative thing obsessively on the flip side certain good things that ive believed have miraculously happened such as me predicting the day of my sons birth in a conversation 4 months prior 

rationally i try to tell myself these instances were probably because they were more predictable than im allowing myself to believe or they were merely coincidences 

my anxiety is mostly triggered by health my son had some dentist visits that i was a mess for the days leading up to the two visits i obsessed over different scenarios of how theyd go on the drive to both of them i said oh this wont go as planned sure enough my son couldnt cooperate in the dentist chair and my anxiety peaked before the second visit i exclaimed if you dont cooperate then youre going to have to go under general anesthesia and you could die 

sure enough he is going under general anesthesia in 12 days ive spent the last three months crying obsessively researching talking with dozens of medical professionals and trying to escape from the manifestation that i put out ive practically mourned him as a way to cope 

i am reassurance seeking daily everyone keeps telling me that things will be fine and to trust my mama intuition which is on fire and freaking out although my rational brain is not

"nuclear physicists in asia discovered that qiprana is actually a lowfrequency highly concentrated form of infrared radiation this radiation is the euphoric energy that is present when experiencing frissonchillsasmr and is called your aura by spiritual enthusiasts

  
for those who doubt that qipranaaura are demonstrably and quantifiably associated with infrared radiation in the human body heres a harvard study of the tibetan people who use this same energy under a different name called tummo to raise their body temperature

  


  


  
and a paper from the cia website on the accuracy of the qispiritual chills and its usage through the eastern practice of qigong

  


  
chinese scientists using arrays of modern detectors tried to monitor emissions originating from qigong masters they met with partial success by detecting increased levels of infrared radiation interestingly the emission oscillated with a low frequency

  
now that thats out of the way lets continue

  
as the taoist concept of qi crossed over into the west in recent years a western word was coined to describe it since qi has a number of properties that seem similar to those of electrical energy in the west it is called bioelectricity

  
researchers have witnessed certain test subjects who were able to consciously emit this form of energy from their bodies

  
this is the equivalent to what can be considered your spiritual energy a simple definition for it is that blissful wave that can most easily be feltrecognized as present while you experience goosebumps from positive situationsstimuli

  
eventually you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps you can even feel it over your whole body flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration

  
learning how to separate that euphoria from our physical reaction is the key for that and to benefit from the many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this brings you

  
this energy has been acknowledged in many cultures and documented under many names like bioelectricity life force prana chi qi orgone rapture tension aura euphoria ecstasy mana vayus asmr nen intent tummo odic force kriyas pitī frisson secret fire the tingles ondemand quickening voluntary piloerection aether chills spiritual chills

  
here are three written tutorials going more indepth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from

  
ps everyone feels it at certain points in their life some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on those are exactly the people you can find on rspiritualchills where they share experiences knowledge and tips on it",1

complaint about it to doctor and told about my lack of focus he thinks he needs to treat focus first to see if anxiety gets better
gave me juneve 50mg
it is giving me a huge anxiety  cant eat bite my lips cant socialize cant leave the house cold and sweaty hands
and then he prescribed clonazepam 025mg everytime i get at an anxiety peak which is everyday some hours after i take juneve
its been 5 days now i am taking both
could anyone who took or take juneve share experience and side effects please
i am not seeing my focus improving since i am so anxious but i did not have a lot of conflicting thoughts inside my mind or a “fog” feeling inside my head as i used to have before taking this med",1

"weird phenomenon caused by anxiety looking for an explanation ive struggled with pretty bad anxiety with varying severity for 8 or so years a few years ago i had a weird thing happen to me like a weird phase where id act and think completely different due to my anxiety

ive been so embarrassed about this since it happened but yet so confused so please dont judge me or anything idk if i can take it lol

so around 2020 i had something happen that caused me to start acting completely different  like really childish i was 15 at the time i think i had always been very closed off and didnt talk to people 

anyway i cant remember the details but i had been very anxious around this time and something caused me to have like an anxiety break i stopped eating properly frequently had panic attacks but the weirdest thing was i would pretty much act like a toddler i could still talk normally and have relatively normal conversations but my interests changed completely listening to any music that wasnt kids music was too much i basically only listened to storybots i could only watch like educational kids shows ones for actual toddlers i never went on youtube or any other social medias during a big part of this 

people who saw me on the outside probably thought i was a bit weird they didnt see how i was acting behind closed doors but they could tell i was acting very childish i could get away with my family thinking this because ive got autism so they passed it off as that i would also enjoy sitting and playing with my younger brother which i formerly hated any mention of anything sexual or anything like that gave me panic attacks i even wore swimming costumes in the showerbath for years following and leading up to this weird thing

this lasted for 6 or more months and although ive recovered from this ive still never told anyone or given anyone who noticed an explanation mainly because im so embarrassed i just desperately want answers 

i definitely missed a lot out but thats all i can remember off the top of my head right now 

tldr
anxiety made me feel like and act like a kid i was stressed if i did anything that wasnt kid like for example i could only listen to kids music normal music gave me panic attacks

im open to questions has anyone else gone through something similar i really want answers thank you ",1

"possible bat bite and rabies anxiety  so basically ive been in the philippines for about a week now and my anxiety is really working over time it started when i looked at my arm and saw some soot as i wiped it off i saw two extremely small black dots close together i havent seen a bat at all this entire trip and theres not really openings im aware of where they could crawl in but im extremely scared nonetheless think one couldve just snuck in without me knowing they dont itch and are not red but theyre still here after around a day and a half but i think its fading after that ive been noticing my arm feeling kind of weird shaking a little in certain positions when i put pressure and its terrified me

"9 quick steps to help you  hey there i posted these steps a few days ago i know anxiety is so crippling and terrifying and i wish i could wave a magic wand and help everyone in this group ive been carrying this heavy feeling since i posted and people said they needed to hear it so i decided to make it an independent post dont give up you can feel better youre needed youre uniqueness is important the world would be less without you being exactly who you are sending lots of love

heres my story i was diagnosed with panic disorder 26 years ago and given a case of zoloft  it was horrible crippling painful isolating and tragically sad after taking one pill and feeling worse i looked for natural approaches and have since fully recovered using holistic methods i just published a book with a detailed method to fix the root cause of anxiety selfloathing and other negative emotions i help people heal the origin of this uncontrollable anxiety bypassing the logic by using the body you can feel better permanently ive witnessed it over and over i don’t think i can post links but i am happy to have a conversation if you want help please dm me

this quick process can help in a pinch

1 notice what you are touching bed floor chair or touch your leg feel that you are in your space present and look around look how everything is ok right now
2 focus on sending your breath down to your toes and up to your head fill your body with your breath
3 ground yourself again touching what is under you while you exhale
4 memoryemotion doesn’t know time
5 help your body get into the present moment the past is over the future isn’t here
6 continue to breath and let yourself feel your feelings
7 this isn’t who you are it is an experience and it is ok to have an experience
8 it is ok to feel safe even if your body is experiencing fear
9 gently repeat until you can balance grounding and panic or the panic subsides i’m so sorry you are going through this 3

id love to hear your thoughts and feedback ",1

do hugs help you guys when you’re in an anxietypanic attack  i have realized that when i have these i will usually want to be hugged after a friend saw it happen for the first time in front of her she asked to make sure she knows what to do if it happens again it helps me know that someone is there and sometimes also makes me more aware of my breathing and will slow it down does it work for you guys too or does it worsen it ,1

"sleep hacks and stress tips that actually worked for me experience   
hi  


here you have my story regarding stress and the connection with sleep  
  
i struggled for a long time with insomnia and bad sleep it felt like that i had tried everything but nothing really worked to the extent that i wanted the stress just did not want to leave my body and mind  
  
for several years now i finally made progress and can finally say that i sleep good and fall asleep pretty fast and easy less stressbetter sleep better sleepless stress  
  
so what did actually work for me here are my 4 biggest and most important steps  
  
1 eating earlier and taking a walk before sleep  
by doing this i feel much more calm and relaxed and am also able to get rid of any excess energy in my body i try to stop eat food minimum 3 hours before bed preferably 45 hours when i walk i do it mindfully in other words not thinking but focusing on my surroundings sounds flowers the wind etc  
  
2 massage and stretching etc  
if you have used your body enough through exercise or walking you should feel pretty tired to really fall asleep faster you need to be relaxed and in your body taking a lukewarm shower stretching and massage really helps a lot getting out of the head and into your body when you are laying in bed focus on your bodily sensations and breath slow instead of thinking about tomorrow etc  
  
3 sleep music  
this one is amazing i put on this spotify playlist below and play it while im falling asleep the music is slow and soothing which in my experience helps to relax more i normally have it on with a sleep timer yes there is one in spotify that you can use that automatically fade out the music after a specific time sometimes i just let it run while i sleep  
you can save this playlist to your library and try it out next time you are going to sleep  
  
  
4 sleep less  
sometimes we cant fall asleep because we have actually been awake for to short amount of time it might sound counterintuitive but try to force yourself up earlier a couple of days and go to sleep later do not go to sleep if you are not jawning a lot and feel really sleepy it makes it easier to fall asleep  


so in conclusion  


be active during the day to burn off energy be in the body through massage and shower listen to calm sleep music the link above and dont sleep too much   


getting a really good sleep helps with stress and most of those tips are great even if you already sleep well the main goal is to get out of your head and into your body   


i really hope this helps for you as much as it did for me

opinions about cognitive behavioral therapy hello community i was wondering if anyone in the community has tried cbt for anxiety and depression i dont know anyone in my circle who has done this and i would like to know from people who has done it what the results were like whether it was worth it and in essence what this type of therapy consists of thank you for your time reading my post,1

anxiety about memoryblackouts does anybody get this type of anxiety anxiety about you doing things that you had no memory of like being in a memory blackout i had a tbi around a year ago and i pretty much have no noticeable symptoms other than the fact that alcohol doesn’t work the same on me anymore 2 drinks and it’s a blackout for me no joke i found this out the hard way of me obviously drinking and then having blackouts i quit drinking as soon as i noticed however since then i’ve been worried about me doing things in a blackout state one time my worries even cane true after i started on some cymbalta i sleepdrunk texted two people nothing embarrassing just drunklike texts that i don’t remember doing at all also no alcohol was consumed obviously just my new cymbalta medication i’ve stopped taking it since,1
"i have some thoughts about my girlfriend and its stressing me out i recently got together with my girlfriend less than 2 months ago and im in a serious relationship for the first time as is she and i have a lot of stupid thoughts that i want to go away and theyre stressing me out 

for example the fact that she is very beautiful and now that she is on vacation men have stopped her from taking her instagram which stresses me out not out of mistrust but out of attention and in my opinion maybe it is because i have not received such attention and the fact that she has 900 followers and i have less and those are some people that like her or she doesnt know i think

the other is cigarettes ive always disliked a girl who smokes but she was an exception and i have told her many times that cigarettes are not good for her and that they harm her terribly because as far as she says she started smoking because of a mental problem and i told her that this is not the way to solve it and that if there is always a problem she can share it and we can solve it together and not solve it alone and smoke because she got stressed and i have noticed that when i have told her this she doesnt accept it or she does not want to and i feel terribly

and the third is that i look a lot at her past and the mistakes she made i wont say what they are but there are quite a few i can give one example is that she nailed a lot of guys as far as me but she have not made sex with them except one and my thought was always to be in a serious relationship and not to nail other girls and i feel like i am in a competition i have sometimes thought that i should have banged other girls and with that i am not going to feel this way but i know thats not a solution

she is really very loving and very caring and to be honest i have not considered breaking up with her and that is why i am asking for help because i am stressing and poisoning myself and i have never felt this way like this before and i love her very much and she does too its really hurting because she said that she have never been in love and thats why i want to remove this negativity

"what would you guys want in a stress ball hello peoples i have a question as a person with adhd and my doctor says i might have anxiety but we aren’t pursuing a diagnosis whose preferred fidgets are stress balls i am sick of stress balls that can’t stand constant use and pop easily or the ones with funky odors reading this sub and other subs i realize that this is a problem for other people too so my question is aside from it being more durable and less prone to popping what do you guys want that is not present in most commercial ones today would it be a textured exterior an easier to clean filling if it does pop like silica beads instead of water beads a smallerlarger one than the usual maybe the whole thing should be covered in fabric no plug that comes off easily for it to look more professional or maybe you guys want a really cute one that calms you when you look at it

you guys don’t need to answer all the questions the main point of the post is just about what you want to see in a stress ball type fidget that is absent in most types today also if you guys know any please let me know anyone who can manufacture something like this i live in asia so someone who can ship their manufactured items there thank you i will ask this same question to several subs like rautism radhd and ranger if you have any suggestions for other subs i can post this on please tell me",1

"moving out anxiety hello i am a 23f and i just moved out of my parents house and into an apartment with my boyfriend of 3 years 26m he has lived on his own since 18 i moved in yesterday and have cried 2 times the night before 4 times the day of and 3 times today 
i didn’t move far only about 20 min but i feel so anxious all the time there are good parts but i miss my parents and my animals and the comfort of home i wish i wasn’t an adult and didn’t have to leave home eventually i keep feeling like i’m not ready but if not know then when does this anxiety and such mean i don’t love my boyfriend 
i grew up having horrible seperation anxiety from my mom and twin sister but this feels a bit like that but also like more i sit here and think “this is my life i’m away from my parents and will never truly be in their care again” they are my safe space i feel i’m going to miss out on a bunch and that i won’t have them here when i need them i have a fear of getting sick and they say i can always come home when i’m sick but it’s different 
this place doesn’t feel like home and i know it may be because of boxes but i also just miss my pets so much 
i was here alone today so i visited home and felt a lot better but my depression is kicking in 
i just can’t believe this is it i’m out of my parents house and i just want to go back but if i go back then it will really hurt my relationship and possibly set me backwards in life every box i unpack gives me anxiety and i keep thinking of the worst such as “how would i pack this all up if my boyfriend and i broke up” like i feel like i’m always planning for the worst as a way to protect myself 
i have no idea what to do we plan on getting a pet within a month or 2 because i know my big thing is having a pet around but these last 3 days have been so much emotionally and i have to work tomorrow which is just adding anxiety 
if you couldn’t tell i don’t do well with change 
any advice would be appreciated",1

"can brain shrinkage caused by chronic stress be potentially reversible i have been continuously suffering with chronic stress for the past 69 months along with bouts of acute stress as an inevitable result they have unleashed utmost havoc and destruction on both my brain and mind for example my memory is at an alltime low and i frequently struggle adequately remembering and retrieving things thoughts and overall information is substantially halted and my decisionmaking skills are impaired yet surprisingly and to my dismay i have done absolutely nothing to alleviate these issues despite promising myself to do so i strongly suspect that as a result of this entire ordeal parts of my brain have shrunk in volume albeit no clinical testsmri scans have verified these claims

my question is through practices like longterm meditationhypnotherapy etc can i potentially reverse the consequences of this event any advice is greatly appreciated thank you",1
"body is finally beginning to relax but my anxiety is making it a bad thing the body keeps the score and ive always known that i hold a lot of my emotions in different parts of my body for different things and when those parts release i feel the emotion but its usually like a one off thing that i expect and can handle it ex i was stretching my hips before bed one night and released some feelings and had a quick good cry
as of recently ive had a lot of things contributing to my anxiety i work fulltime bartending stressful enough in a toxic work environment moneys tight i live alone and feel lonely a lot boyfriend lives 4hrs away and has opposite schedule as me friends and family are similar situation its caused me to very tense everywhere at all times and thats caused issues on its own ive taken up some lifestyle changes to help with it and they have
just in case youre curious and want to try some of these things fully sober more water less coffee hobbies that calm me like puzzles and crochet combination of heat pads chamomile tea and tart cherry juice at night with a lighthearted show on until i fall asleep
so yes these things are beginning to help me and i can already see some changes unfortunately the feeling of my body relaxing is a cause of anxiety for me for whatever reason i have a vague idea but i think thats something ill unpack with a professional but i guess im just looking to see if anyone else feels the same way
like after work ill shower and do my night routine and suddenly feel that warmish coolish feeling come over me and i start to feel tired and it freaks me out ill panic myself into staying up even though im tired
just now i did my third night in a row of yoga and i had a complete breakdown for no discernible reason before i even stretched anything
its to the point that i have tight chest pain on my left side that hurts and any time i put a heat pack on it and feel the muscles begin to relax i get anxious that somethings happening to my heart i cant sleep well without someone i trust present boyfriend or friend
just looking to see if others relate i already feel alone living alone and wanted to find comfort knowing this is something that happens and that its okay and will be okay ",1

"i’m lost and don’t know what to do tw for sh i’m sorry if this is long but i feel like i needed to explain everything in detail for people to better understand

i 18f live with my boyfriend 19m and i’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and dyscalculia possibly autism or adhd since the grade 5 i’ve struggled a lot growing up with it even having to go to a special high school that helps kids with mental health and learning disability’s my anxiety started getting worse in grade 12 last year 

i’m a very sensitive person and i cry a lot over stupid things and little things when i get frustrated or when i get extremely nervous i cry and i don’t know why it happens i try so hard to keep myself calm but nothing works i get easily frustrated and overwhelmed which i try not to but always seem to not work i’m not very smart and i’ve known this since as early i can remember i’m an extremely slow learner and learn best from physically being shown what to do i also struggle with self harm i know it’s terrible to say but i like hurting myself because i don’t want to hurt others like a stress reliever

 it’s impacted me finding a job as well i used to work at starbucks last year for about 4 months before i couldn’t handle it and quit i couldn’t handle the stress and how fast paste it was it was making my anxiety worse i haven’t had a job since and now i have to look for one i get overwhelmed and start to cry at the conversation and having to search for jobs

 i went for a trail shift at a local coffee shop to which i was nervous and i knew i would end up breaking down and crying i tried so hard but i ended up crying and the owner sent me home i also went for a job interview at a local bookshop i was excited but nervous about going everyone i knew was excited for me even my boyfriend saying that i will get the job i ended up crying during the job interview cause i didn’t know how to answer two of their questions i didn’t get the job obviously i broke down crying in the car to my boyfriend as he drove us home i felt terrible and ended up relapsing that night 

my boyfriend is an apprentice jeweller in his 3rd and last year he says that it’s hard on him too which i completely understand and feel so fucking bad that i don’t have a job he always helps me and the best thing to ever happen to me i just don’t have any motivation to work to live and wake up every single day just to feel like shit 

i’m also lonely i don’t have any friends anymore my only friend moved to another state with her boyfriend and we’ve distant ever since i stay home during the day while my boyfriend works 8am  5pm and i don’t talk to anyone but him his littler sister 16 and my little sister 15 

i’ve never been on medication since my mum and dad never bothered but i was put in therapy off and on through primary school and that was it i’ve never been to the psych ward or the hospital for anything mental health related i’m struggling and i don’t know how long i can keep living like this i feel so stressed and overwhelmed everyday

"how do you tamper anxiety and overthinking especially while in a talking stage specifically when people don’t reply do your texts im 18 and ive been talking to this girl for a couple weeks and i’m really staring to like her but i keep worrying and overthinking when she doesn’t reply for over 30 minutes which i know is ridiculous but i just can’t help it i feel my heart rate raise and everything it’s bad and i’d really like to work on it so it doesn’t affect our relationship as friends i e been trying and distracting myself witt stuff to do but my thoughts still race i am diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder which might make that attachment worse i’m not sure i’ve also been cheated on a handful of times in past relationships but i’ve mainly done long distance relationships so maybe that’s why but it definitely makes the anxiety and overthinking worse but i don’t want to bring the past into our relationship i want to deal with it and have a healthy relationship with this beautiful lady if anyone has any tips for me please share them thank you

"physical symptoms of stress hi  
  
about two years ago i had some mental health issues where i started having what i believe are anxietypanic attacks and derealisation since then i have woken up pretty much every morning with a surge in my head dizziness pressure in my chestupper stomach between the ribs i have done blood tests sleep apnea tests blood pressure tests high every other time i test testosterone tests neurological tests and so on no brain scan been to the eyedoctor to test vision they said eye musculature were strained which i find weird since it was 9am i havent woken up feeling rested in these two years and i dont remember having a pleasant feeling in my body but i wouldnt say that im overly depressed just accustomed to this awful feeling that comes and goes and at this point i have a hard time imagining that this is all in my head been to the doctors and psychiatrists several times but blood tests and meditation are usually what they offer as a solution been trying to find obvious connection to what makes it worse but cant seem to pinpoint anything specific would like to make a life change such as changing jobs but it is very difficult as im not functioning at normal capacity and havent been for a long time this whole ordeal also increases my social anxiety by a lot since meeting people while feeling like i have a bad drug trip is not very comfortable

"247 lightheadedness visionbalance problems could this all be anxiety  hi i’m a 28 yo m here for a little over a decade i’ve suffered from minor anxiety my anxiety has always been manageable for me and it’s never required me to be on any sort of medication for it i’m a former alcohol drinker and nicotine user and would consider myself moderate users of both leaning heavier on the cigarettevape side of things that all stopped for me at the beginning of last year though 

i discovered a small growthbump on my back which caused some concern for me fearing the worst i went to my doctor who loosely diagnosed it as a lipoma he recommended me see a specialist unfortunately for me i wouldn’t see him for a couple months due to scheduling during my time of not really knowing i started to notice some psychical changes in my day to day i’ve been a carpenter for 8 years and have always been an active person so i was very aware of slight changes in my psychical abilities i first noticed a slight imbalance walking about the job site this was accompanied by pressure in my left ear almost a clogged feeling i assumed a possible wax blockage throwing off my equilibrium that ended up not being the case after i went to my doctor and he discovered my ear was clear of a blockage in the following days at work i started to become lightheaded and my eyes became very sensitive to light  i also started not being able to drink caffeine which i was very used to drinking on a daily basis i found the caffeine to worsen the psychical symptoms i was having at this point in time the  growthbump is still worrying me as well as another stressor involving my girlfriend traveling solo for her work which always made me slightly anxious a little over two weeks of me noticing changes in my psychical ability i was not able to work entirely when i say 247 lightheadedness i mean all day every day my balance was off along with my vision being blurry making it very difficult to read text i normally wouldn’t have an issue with im no longer able to work largely due to the constant lightheadedness and general unsteadiness on my feet which was obviously concerning 

fast forward a couple months and im still out of work with all these symptoms remaining the same around this time i also find out that bump i was worried about was just a small cyst that was of no concern at all great news……i thought that was really the trigger for all my psychical problems unfortunately that was not the case and here i am a year later dealing with the same issues my anxiety surrounding my health has skyrocketed with the psychical symptoms staying around even after i was told my initial worry the cyst was nothing to worry about i’ve gotten so much blood work done along with ekgs mris and even seeing multiple specialists everything comes back normal my life’s completely changed as i’m still out of work after almost a year of the onset of psychical symptoms 

could i be living in my head could this really be all stress and anxiety ruining my everyday life i’ve tried ssris and snris with no luck just started seeing a therapist as well i’m going to start taking magnesium glycinate and vitamin b2 as they both come recommended from a neurologist if this is indeed anxietystress that i’m unable to get control of it sure is  crazy how it can affect your body let me know what you think  ",1

this experience has made me realize i kinda feel the same way at most of the jobs i have had in the past at my last internship i was the youngest out of three interns and they really made it a lot of fun and helped me get the most out of it however i felt this extreme hesitance to interact with the full time employees i work a part time job on my college campus and i feel the same way with the other employees who work there but i don’t really need to interact with them since the office i work in is shared with a larger department and i only have to report to my boss who is often only in once a week 

i really don’t know what to do and i’m kinda slipping into some bad coping methods nothing too bad just only eating one type of food and sleeping with the lights on do i quit and just go back home and find an internship there i don’t even know if that would make me feel better because of my prior job history i think it only feels worse here because i don’t have any connections in town any words of advice would be greatly appreciated thanks",1

back before my sister asked me to be her maid of honor she told me she was worried i’d be too anxious to do it i told her i wanted her to do what she thought was best but that i wanted to be a part of her day my worry is that i will start having an anxiety attack and that i will get stuck with it one of the things that makes me incredibly anxious is feeling trapped if i feel like i can’t leave because of social obligation i will get incredibly anxious and i’ve even almost passed out a few times i’m terrified this is going to happen

"weird symptoms hey guys maybe some of you can relate idk but i’ve been dealing with these random symptoms forever now it seems like i’m having inner vibrations daily and tingling  numbness along with random muscle twitching and sometimes i get these waves of uneasiness or like feeling off balance or just off in the head like poor coordination all of a sudden i’m only 24 and this has been going on for like 12 months now non stop all doctors keep saying is it’s anxiety but it’s frustrating because it’s so dehabilitating and it’s like how can you make it stop 

it’s so frustrating to all of a sudden have “anxiety” so dehabilitating to the point you have all these symptoms that truly feel like a neurological disorder is forming or something has anyone ever dealt with these symptoms on a daily level",1

"can’t urinate for my drug test not sure if this is the right sub to ask for help but i need to pass a drug test within the next week for my summer internship i’ve gone in twice now for testing but i couldn’t pee either time even after drinking around 100 oz of water it’s not that i don’t have to pee i need to pee so bad that my bladder hurts like hell but i physically cannot pee due to anxiety i think on top of that the lady kicks me out of the bathroom after 4 minutes so i’m already worried about time

i’ve tried focusing on my breathing imagining i’m elsewhere thinking about nothing at all flexing my bladder muscles distracting myself on my phone but nothing works out of the above methods looking at my phone has been the most effective for me historically since it distracts my mind and lets my body do its thing in the drug testing bathroom however i have found no success 

i’ve always been shy about peeing but it’s gotten a lot better in the last few months i used to not be able to pee at all in a public bathroom if anyone else was in there with me

at this point i’m worried i won’t be able to do my internship that was extremely competitive and that i’ve worked so hard to get simply because i can’t pee in a fucking cup please help any advice is greatly appreciated

"i’m so scared my life is over please help  i’ll preface by saying i do have a doctors appointment set for next week but ive been scrolling and scrolling— just making myself worse i’ve been overthinking myself out of my wits so i’m just hoping to maybe get some help

i’m young 23f i am active extremely so due to work i was averaging 40k some days if my fit bit is accurate

i ended up with two tailors bunions due to shoe issues as well as very thick callouses all over my foot they never caused much issue though so i was told to keep an eye on them two days ago while finishing a workout i felt pins and needles in my tailors bunion that shot up to my thigh i know that this could be many things but i also had a slight worry and  i started googling

i immediately saw degenerative neuropathy i’ve been scared ever since and i swear it’s been rapidly progressing

my hands have felt numb and my head has swam since yesterday though i have been crying a lot due to worry

i’m not diabetic nor have i ever drank nor am i overweight i really never noticed anything like this before two days ago and now it feels like it could be rapidly getting worse the pain is not stopping me from getting around but the ball of my heel and my bunion keep tingling and dull aching

i guess i’m just terrified that the only thing it could be is neuropathy i just maybe wanted some comfort that possibly that isn’t the only answer i swear i’ve felt it rapidly progressing but it’s only been two days and i never noticed it before i started googling i’m so afraid obviously this isn’t helping my anxiety

"read this if you are stressed hi reader just like you ive had stress before the stress has been bad then really bad where my arms have almost been temporarily paralyzed i use my hands and arms a lot because of my work i havent tried it all i havent hit rock bottom yet but i have been told some things that i would like to share with someone else who has stress its not a magic cure and its not big news but i have read a bunch of the posts in this here and i can see many people who are unwell 

i dont know where im going with this but i thought id share with you

the symptoms youre having fast heartbeat dizziness fear memory loss and tightning around chest etc is your body hitting the breaks it is signaling that you must take it easy because if not then it will force you to recognizing the symptoms of your stress and taking them seriously is the first step in coping with stress 

tell your brain youll get through it telling yourself youll be ok and that youll get through this might seem platonic and useless but do it anyway tell it until you believe it because eventually you can reprogram your brain not to dramatize your situation which is exactly what it is doing as it kind of gets into a survivalstate of fight flight or freezeresponse

try to cut off as much as you can from your weekly activities make a prioritizinglist of things you can take a break from until you get better do it even though there might be someone upset about it because in the end you need to be there for yourself before you can be there for others

lay down in silence 15 minutes every day doing nothing saying nothing just laying there and taking slow breaths your body depends on oxygen you depend on oxygen  and when stressed our bodies become full of tension and we might forget to breathe give your body at least 15 minutes of focused breathing out of those 24 hours youre doing your body a favor

another thing is to drink water even if you dont like it people with stress who also drink caffeine and tea are not often considering that they dehydrate themselves while increasing their heartbeat forgetting to drink water you have a phone set an alarm

if you wake up every morning sleeping through alarms and having a hard time it means your body needs more rest give it what it needs because everything we do requires energy and not having energy is like working against friction thus making it more difficult for yourself would you really drive a car with an unoiled motor


take yourself seriously talk about stress with friends and family and take it easy i hope someone out here might find this useful

"terrified of lung cancer 19 m about a month and a half ago i had a chest infection which was quite bad but since then i’ve had a persistent cough where i’m coughing up yellow phlegm i’ve also had chest and back pain since

i’ve had a clear chest xray my blood oxygen levels are at 99 and my chest sounds clear to doctors i can’t help but think they’ve missed something serious and they’ve just brushed it off as bronchitis because surely that would’ve appeared on the chest xray and since when did it cause back pain i see to many stories of lung cancer being missed on xrays

the backshoulder pain has gotten worse recently and whilst i do go to the gym regularly it does not feel like a pulled muscle it feels more like throbbing pain deep down which makes me think it’s lung related

i don’t know what to do i’ve been the doctors several times and they don’t seem worried but obviously the chance of a 19 year old having lung cancer is so low so they wouldn’t even think of it i also doubt they’d give me a ct scan without any reason to i live in the uk so this would be through the nhs

"can social anxiety be linked to a higher iq  the weird ones are the cool ones don’t unweird yourself

to me it always seems as if the awkward or weird people are highly intelligent so i did some research to answer the question can social anxiety be linked to a higher iq

you guys know those out of the box eccentric strange even kind of people the ones who aren’t stuck in the repetition of being generic giving generic responses expecting generic answers the ones who aren’t confined to a box assuming anyone who doesn’t fit into that box is weird yeah those are the cool people the people who are really living generic people are the weird ones they are like manipulated plants growing in a dome or a sort of laboratory like programmed droids

i like weird conformity is boring but for the most part inescapable we all follow something all working towards some sort of goal or purpose usually what we call ‘success’ or even if it’s working to stand out we all follow some sort of guideline and in spite of if you want to admit it or not we are all a little weird but there is a whole category of people who miss out on life by not allowing themselves to be weird enough

i always seen those awkward out of place quiet ones when i was a kid and i knew they had so much to say but didn’t maybe in fear of being ridiculed or looked at funnythats how i felt so i can only assume there are others out there who felt the same you had an opinion for most things and were knowledgable on certain subjects but you never spoke up because you didn’t know if maybe your response was weird and the kids would judge you for having out the box thinking

when we are deemed as weird as a young kid we learn to safeguard the things we love we keep them hidden within our hearts in fear of someone mocking us out of cruelty or just plain ignorance

i’ve learned as i got older that its stupid to hide the real you the things you like and the thoughts that come to you are uniquely yours your neighbor might have a less creative more basic opinion on the same topic but that doesnt mean there is something wrong with you for thinking outside of the box your other neighbor may be so outside of the box hes lost over in left field but that’s okay too were all different and all weird in our own ways don’t unweird yourself get out there live take up enough space for all the parts of youbeautiful tragic devious kind and even strangeto come together

i personally think the ones that people consider “weird” are the deep thinkers the old souls the caretakers the loners the quiet ones these people look at life in a different light with a sensory overload and trapped in mind thoughts that something different must have happened in their genetic coding because nobody else seems to share the same level of insight into the layers of depth that they see everywhere most people seem to follow a narrow path with signs helping them lead the way everything simple no questions needing answers then the ‘weird’ ones have a thousand different paths that seem to disappear or lead to another one shortly after and then lead back and through and over and under and everywhere in between nothing is clear questions are everywhere

these people usually end up expressing themselves in some sort of creative manner through the different forms of art music writing painting designing and so on to be able to see the inside of the minds of these people is so intriguing to me they bring so much more flavor to life

i truly believe we all have something to bring to the table but a lot of us are stuck in trying to “find ourselves” we shouldn’t be searching for who we are but instead expressing the person we truly feel we are inside instead of trying to run from it you can’t run from yourself your opinions ideas and thoughts make you you dont be afraid to raise your hand and let it be your time to speak

“shout out to the wild the curious the rebels and risk takers you are the leader of your hearts desires and artists to your souls inner fire” helen edwards

i remember when i was younger i was so bad at expressing myself to the point where i started to believe something was wrong with me

it started when i was young i was a very shy kid almost to the point of feeling sick when in the presence of people i may have to communicate with especially if my mom dad or sister wasn’t around when one of my parents didn’t speak for me my sister a year older than i am would do so which probably didnt help in terms of breaking out of that shell i was in

i was the quiet girl all through elementary like no word of a lie i did not speak unless spoken to unless it came to my friends i had a small group of friends me and three other girls and we were inseparable i met them in grade 2 and we all still talk to this day i was blessed to have them when i was with them i could be my goofy confident self because i knew they liked me i wasnt trying to prove myself to them i guess with everyone else that’s how i felt

i worried about sounding weird or out of place or stupid even so i stayed quiet even in group projects i spoke when spoken to although half the time i had great ideas for the project and i’d sit there with the thought on the tip of my tongue psyching myself out about all the possible outcomes the group laughs or gives me a funny look or even if they simply shut down the idea now they all just heard how i thought and get to read a little bit into me and judge i didn’t want that i’d rather just be quiet so that nobody could have an opinion of me i might have been the boring quiet girl but that was better than maybe possibly being judged or ridiculed

i remember in grade three in gym class we had to play duck duck goose almost every gym class and i hated it with a passion it was my least favorite gym activity because it singled people out when you are the one running around the circle you are the center of attention every eye on you and god forbid you didnt get chosen people may think you’re unlikeable or a loser for never getting chosen i was a nervous wreck every time i knew gym was coming up eventually i told my teacher how nervous it made me and she told me i didnt have to play now i was the kid sitting on the side not playing duck duck goose probably even weirder but i didnt care i got out of the devils circle then my teacher got pregnant and we got a replacement she made me play duck duck goose bitch

it really was the best thing for me though we have to learn to get out of our comfort zones if we ever want to be the confident poised person we hope to be we can not live life hiding behind or wall held back by our own timidity gotta break out of those shells guys

for me it took a long time to say the least a lot of soul searching selfimprovement techniques and mostly pushing myself past limits i thought unattainable i waited too long though i stayed stuck in my ways all throughout high school i assumed “no one would ever get it” or “they may think i’m weird”

i moved to a new city when i went to high school 2 hours away from my friends only person i knew at the school was my sister she made friends i stuck to myself people even tried to be friends with me at first but these people seemed exciting and like they had something interesting to talk about all the time and boring old me had nothing to bring to the table so i allowed myself to be intimated and shy away from any genuine connection

i regret that a lot because i know i would have eventually opened up and been my goofy self that all my friends back at home loved and possibly been loved by more people too i avoided talking to anyone i asked every teacher if i could do group projects alone i walked home for lunch alone or hid in the bathroom stalls i didn’t know how to make friends but also didnt want to try but didn’t want anyone to see i was a loner at the same time

i thought high school was never gonna end i became very angry with the world and started lashing out on my family i couldnt express myself anywhere else in the world so when it came to the people i loved i was a monster i would try to have a normal discussion and if someone did something as simple as disagree with one thing i said i would freak out and claim how the people are so lost and “no one gets it” “no one will ever get it” i blamed everyone but myself for why i felt so out of place and misunderstood

i eventually started drinking heavily and upgraded to drugs a lot of them i did them in my room alone mostly sometimes with the guy i met on facebook who went to my highschool and eventually became my boyfriend who got kicked out in grade 9 so we did not experience highschool together all i wanted to do was escape

drugs helped nothing hiding out helped nothing i became so retreated into myself and disconnected with the world to the point where i didnt want to do anything everything became harder and felt absolutely pointless i was a miserable specimen dragging myself through each day assuming it was always going to be that way how the hell was i supposed to break out of this darkness that seemed to be enveloping my entire being in my mind there was no way out i couldnt just read selfhelp books and tell a therapist how i felt and everything would get better

i put my parents through hell i couldnt have a normal conversation without it ending up with my screaming at the top of my lungs hitting myself on the head throwing things or smashing my fist through a wall i destroyed their house many times they have called the cops on me about five different occasions afraid of me really hurting myself or someone else

i couldn’t express the thoughts spiraling around my mind never understanding how people couldn’t put two and two together reading expressions social cues and all that so instead i expressed myself through violence my loved ones were supposed to get it right to understand

anger was the only relief i seemed to have to sort help but it wasnt helping anyone now people seen how hard it was for me to be able to express myself obviously if i went to lengths to hurt myself and spaz out right maybe now they would see that i just had a harder time than other people in spilling my mind on the outside but nope now i was the girl who couldnt express myself due to my own issues as well as the crazy bitch who screams and hits herself and walls when she doesn’t get her way the anger helped nothing



when i got out of high school i knew i needed a job if i wanted to support my drug habit and maybe a car so i can run away and fuck off to the mountains and live alone i applied everywhere and anywhere i’d take whatever i can get i ended up in a kitchen i love cooking and thought it would be a good fit within a month i was opening the restaurant myself prepping and cooking the lunch menu on my own and became a valuable part of the business i was proud of myself

if you ever worked in a kitchen you know it’s not very easy to stay quiet a lot of chefscooks are the same loud opinionated arrogant at times cocky proud a sensitive person trying to work in a kitchen good luck haha that was me and man was it hard any criticism i would get i teared up and went to cry in the walk in then eventually i started to deny i could ever make a mistake so i made an excuse for anything i did wrong i blamed something or someone else it was never my fault

over time working in such a high stress over simulated industry i eventually gained more of a backbone i realized it was respected to admit your wrong doings and simply do better next time i spoke up when i knew i was right and i didnt take anyones bullshit i became proud of who i was and slowly was expressing myself more because i assumed my opinions had value plus everyone is friends in the food industry you all love to complain about the customers and about the night or morning shift not doing their switchovers properly we are all a big family of bitching and complaining about things we know will never change

i didnt even realize it was happening but i gradually broke out of the shell i was in my whole life i started going out with friends and being myself while doing so i wasnt afraid to be me anymore and it genuinely is the best feeling in the world when you realize the darkness has slowly lifted

i still love my alone time probably more than i should and i still let it get to me that no one will ever see the same picture or hear the same song i do we all interpret things differently sometimes i feel i can read into exactly what someone is thinking and i help them get their words across because i can tell they were struggling a lot of the time my intuition is spot on and sometimes it isn’t we never really know exactly what is in someones mind or soul but that’s what makes life interesting

learning to accept that instead of claiming your are misunderstood indefinitely is the first step to making life a little easier on yourself we are all misunderstood and none of us are special because of it and the world owes us nothing you owe it to yourself to express your unique self in this world or hide behind a rock and never know what it’s like to really live that’s cool too but please don’t complain that life wasnt enough it’s enough for a lot of us because we found what we needed to make it enough for us",1

id be so thankful if anyone could talk me through this comfort me offer any advice allow me to explain in detail of everything you need to know it will be long so if anyone takes the time i really appreciate you

theres a tldr at the bottom but the title is quite selfexplanatory too

i would like to emphasize that the nature of this post relating to anxiety and loneliness is that my partner said he wants to be alone after becoming too overwhelmed by me and did not specify for how long he did not explicitly state he is leaving me but that he just doesnt know if he can do this to be there for me that he feels he is selfish

i do not know when or how he will respond and i am afraid he will leave me this anxiety has been immensely debilitating for me



to begin my partner and i both have depression and we have both struggled with it our entire lives in our own respective ways we both have gone through this life without any real true meaningful connections to anyone no lasting healthy friendshipsrelationships no family bonds

when we met it was online through the streaming site twitch i had been streaming myself playing games in an attempt to finally pull myself out of my selfisolation my depression as i had gone nearly 6 years now without talking to virtually anyone rarely ever leaving my home my room the last time i had any real interaction i had was when i had a relatively close bond with a friend group id stumble on one night when i was depressed and drunk playing a pvp game i was unhealthily addicted to we were close for a year but all drifted apart as interests changed before that i was selfisolating due to depression for even more years

after that time with those friends i went back to selfisolating yet again because i just didnt know how to be open with anyone how to feel connected i was barely surviving with poor funds because i could never hold a job for long i could barely function but id put on a cheerful disposition long enough when id stream that i almost believed i was getting better id talk about mental health a lot on stream telling myself id practice selfcare that i was moving on from my empty painful past that theres always hope that overcoming depression is possible

still i have awful debilitating anxiety in general especially with people you could say that i always feel i am on a completely separate wavelength from almost anyone who interacts with me i dont feel that i am really better than anyone even if someone is nice i just find it very hard to be comfortable around many thoughts and mannerisms of others if that makes any sense im only comfortable in very specific circumstances

i try to be kind and attentive when i do interact but it is very difficult for me to genuinely feel connected to feel like i truly enjoy anyones company id see so many people come and go in my streams but none stayed because i was only interested in having true committed connections not simply to entertain viewers

i had been streaming for months mostly consistently playing the same pvp game that i was addicted to i was extremely burnt out on and depressed by it but it was one of my only other forms of interacting with others even though there was a lot of toxicity due to the nature of pvp games i had been trying to quit playing it for years did finally quit last year as an aside i was always high on my streams because it helped me cope with everything unfortunately eventually i started having consistent anxiety attacks from it due to my unstable mental state sometimes i would end streams early without specifying why because i was having an anxiety attack

finally came along the person that would become my partner into my stream i was still extremely wary and afraid of him too just like any other but i again tried to give the benefit of the doubt he joined nearly all of my streams after our initial meeting for many months i was so happy to have his company as time went on he was the first person i ever became truly comfortable with in my entire life most of my streams ended up being for him more than anything i looked forward to him showing up always hoped he would

enough months passed by that i finally built the courage to ask if hed like my discord so that we can talk anytime we want instead of just in streams he said hed be happy to the coming months after were some of the happiest id ever had in my life we spent most days together as much as we could having casual conversation in a call while playing games with each other bonding in that way my feelings started deepening and as a result i began to share in more detail about some of my personal life which most of it is depressing

as yet another aside i completely stopped streaming due to struggles with problematic raiders so the rest of this is just about my partner and i spending time together on calls

after about a little over a year of bonding with each other i realized i had fallen in love with him i was terrified of this fact because i had a past history of the only 2 relationships ive had broken onesided relationships as it turns out i have only been made aware of the term recently codependency thats what i had and in both times i was the taker in that dynamic

to put into perspective those past relationships were never official but in my mind they may as well have been since the nature of it was very similar to that of a romantic relationship during my time in those relationships as a young teenager to young adult i had very little selfcontrol i was so dependent so in need of comfort and love that i was always demanding of it i had little boundaries i couldnt bring myself to seek real help for these problems so i kept putting my burdens on those that i loved it got to the point where the pain became so much for the both of us

one i completely withdrew from and they never reached back out the second i willingly let go of the relationship admitting how much stress i had put on them and didnt want to do that anymore to them that and i knew that while this person loved me in some capacity i knew they didnt love me the way i wanted to be loved or at least how i believed i wanted to be loved at that time

acknowledging all this to myself i promised myself i would learn from those mistakes to never put someone else through that then i again built the courage to tell him i loved him that i wanted to be together with him to live my life with him to my delight he said he loved me and wanted all of that too with me

thus we came into a longdistance relationship i told him honestly because i had never gotten over my past that i was worried i could be too much for him that no one has been able to handle me he said he still wanted to be together and so we were

for a time it was fine over the months we have been doing our best to be good to each other to be there for each other to love each other unfortunately i was getting stressed out from lots of things going on in my living circumstances with family and remnants of my past came back my depression my loneliness my want for love comfort validation attention feelings of abandonment unresolved hurt from my previous relationships

i always told him that we could be open with each other about anything my partner took much longer than me to open up even a little bit but i was patient content to just be with him id encourage him but never force it on him that wasnt the problem the problem was i was just too open and started to fall back into old problematic behaviors

i was too open about all those things of my past how much pain i was in putting those burdens on him every other day that little things hurt me so much that he had to be so careful around me hed make mistakes id be hurt and tell him as such but those mistakes werent really his fault it was me i kept wanting certain responses comforts he couldnt give due to his own depression he had never learned to do that and hed never been in love before so he had no way of knowing how to navigate

thats not to say he hasnt had his own moments of struggle due to his own depression and not necessarily from me but i exasperated the issues for him made him feel pressured and stressed to be perfect that he lost sight of how wonderful love is that he is convinced it is all his fault when its not that he is the one that cannot give me what i deserve that he has to be perfect and never make mistakes never cause hurt im so guilty that he feels that way ive told him now that i dont expect that from him and that im sorry that if it ever across that way in the past

hes helped me more than i can ever express been so sweet and understanding of me so considerate as much as he can in all my needs i went through a long period of time where i kept being too afraid to truly love him because of my own hurt in the past that i hadnt forgiven myself for after many months i finally was able to trust him to love him without reservation after talking about it enough because he still loved me accepted me forgave me so i could do that for myself i was able to stop doing harmful things to myself such as quit using and abusing substances altogether through him

but as a result of his selfless efforts that he really did try so hard for me gave me so many chances i did this to him what point is there to me being better now if ive done this to him i cannot emphasize enough the deep guilt remorse shame i feel in myself i really thought i could better to him that i wouldnt repeat my mistakes but i still did

during last month was the biggest strain on our relationship where he finally expressed to me that even though hed say he was fine when id check in on him he really wasnt he had been overwhelmed all this time his own reasons for selfisolating was because he hates who he is that who ive loved is just a facade that he is and has always been empty terrible and he is afraid of being hurt

i know that isnt all that defines him though i know it is a part of him now i accept that but i know he is more than his depression too

while i always expressed that i love and accept everything of him i do understand his hesitation to be devoted to someone and to change because in my own depression love is a very complicated thing to process and such a contrasting experience to depression

yet it is no excuse what ive done i was constantly hurting him its no wonder the last time we talked a week ago that he wanted to be alone because i essentially emotionally drained him into this state took advantage of him

i do love him so dearly i was so selfish for all of this due to this happening ive resolved id be happy with any little effort he gives as long as he is with me i dont need any more than that i will appreciate and cherish anything he is capable of because i know he truly loves me and cares about me

i likely deserve to lose him but im still so terrified of being all alone again and i dont want him to ever be alone like that again we are all we have but he expressed he feels we may be better off without each other that he doesnt deserve me that i deserve better even though for me all hes ever done is been so wonderful to me i wish i had given him more opportunities to feel that about me too otherwise maybe he wouldnt be saying this now

before he stopped talking with me i asked him if i could at least keep sending him some messages of my thoughts i couldnt help but do so for 3 days ive been desperate for relief because i have no one besides him trust no one besides him so id been trying to join these online chat rooms for depression to try and at least vent maybe even get some advice i did manage to talk for a little while with some individuals and they suggested i do truly leave him alone at least for a couple of days

i took that advice and sent him one last message telling him that i trust him that he can come to me with his thoughts whenever he feels ready it feels like an eternity without him i am so distraught because he is all i have and i am all he has i dont ever want to give up on him i love him so much

in all my previous messages i did my very best to share with him that i was deeply sorry for what id done  that despite everything thats happened circumstances can change the emotions can change in time that this rough period of time will pass that love doesnt have to be only of suffering that amid all of that we did have many wonderful precious moments together if only he could remember that see that there is still hope in all of it

that i am going to finally search for help that is precisely why im here ive never gotten help for my depression before ive always just tried to wish it away but after this theres no denying now as scared as i am as difficult as it may be i have to do something about this i will for me for him for our love

im just so afraid that he really will put all of this on himself wont forgive himself wont forgive me wont want to keep trying i worry for his health his life because he is in a very deep depression too he means everything to me ill do anything i love him with everything i am

i said he doesnt have to do this with me to change because i know how daunting changing can be particularly when depression convinces you that you cant ever change but i myself do want to try i want to try for him to oppose my fears doubts and pain so he can see its possible that while i wont force him i can be there to build his own confidence his own selflove so he can seek help too to see his worth

im trying not to make it seem that its only about me it was about me for so long but now i truly want to be there for my partner in all the ways i wasnt before but i fear im too late to change that how can i be motivated at all if he does decide to leave me i cant stand the thought of living without him

wed say our love was the most profound wonderful thing to ever experience to ever exist that it is neverending beyond anything of reality beyond imagination that it would be our foundation in life that we would live for each other until death and beyond be there for each other in anything and everything

i still believe in that but i know that wont happen unless something changes and that i must start on that difficult path to healing i will for our love

i dont know how i will get help or how much it will help but i have to i have to be stronger i have to be better so our love can be sustainable so my partner and i can be healthy happy fulfilled together

i dont ever want to give up on him because he was the only one that was there for me when i most needed someone now i want to do that for him if hell still have me

my partner did not specify how long he wanted to be alone for but he did say he would eventually tell me his thoughts in the meantime i have been doing everything i can to still care for myself but admittedly i really really miss him and am struggling without him

i ended up sending another message to him 3 days later to at least check up on him since i know he has no support system at all though neither do i as of now it has been a total of one week since he stopped talking to me i havent obligated him to respond thus far but i expressed to him before i tried to let him be that i would appreciate at least some sort of acknowledgementupdate once a week has passed i fear bringing it up now that it would stress him out more when he is in this fragile state but so am i

i am really trying to be strong for him to give him space he has been strong for me for months while we were in contact so i want to show him that i really will be there for him like he has for me i want to do that because i do love him and feel he is worth it

i want to keep checking on him as he did say i could send him messages even if he doesnt respond the first time and only other time we separated like this was fairly recent as well but for only 2 days he said messaging him my thoughts helped him realize he wanted to keep trying however without any feedback for this amount of time i am just so anxious i may or may not be providing anything of value to him at this point he was so defeated and the time without contact has been longer than i am comfortable with due to my overactive anxiety

i truly want to be believe this can be salvaged to gain his trust to recognize that while we are at a low now it doesnt have to be a permanent state because i am going to seek help in my mental conditions to attempt everything i can to improve myself improve our relationship

its so hard to come to terms that even a love as wellmeaning as ours isnt infallible because we are human i never expected perfection but i did romanticize love itself idealize the concept of it that we as two depressed people could both do that for each other find happiness together to live in complete devotion openness dependence i didnt consider just how heavy that pressure was for my partner because for me i felt truly closer to him in that because he would indulge me in that too

i do think he really wanted to provide that for me that is why he is so ashamed and guilty in himself now but he is scared of such expectations i see now how unrealistic it was of me to want that because that sort of ultimate love that sort of immense responsibility over someones life is unsustainable and unhealthy for anyone to bear especially with depression it is hard enough to do care for yourself let alone for someone else no matter how much you love them

love wont cure us as much as i wish it would but all this has truly incentivized me to try to realize me i had been relying on my partner as a crutch because of this happening i am so afraid of those lasting consequences of what has already happened allowing myself to be complacent in it will continue to harm not only him but myself my life i dont want to keep going on this way of losing the one i truly love losing everything to this again all these years later

i realize there is a real possibility he can give up that either of us can give up at any time i cant simply let go right now given how much i love him i still want to believe in him he said he is sorry for doing this to me and doesnt know anymore i know inside he loves me so deeply i feel it sincerely it is understandably unbearably anxietyinducing for me to hear him say what he did but i know his depression his own respective fears within himself is playing a very large role in this a well aside from my own mistakes

until i know implicitly that he says he cantwont do this he hasnt definitively said so i am trying to be brave in this to truly have growth in myself so that if he does decide to stay with me and i truly hope he will to hold onto our love so that we really can support each other in that ability to address our depression even if it never goes away that we are doing what we can to make the best of life together

i do understand how difficult this all is as i struggled with similarly when i decided id learn to love and accept love from my partner i will keep trying to move forward with that in mind to do what i can to consider his conflict of feelings too as he did for me all the months he listened to me

most of all i so deeply miss my partner i am so lonely i wish he were here now to feel his precious love once more that i will never place such unreasonable responsibilities on him again

i am so anxious because i dont know what is going to happen as it has been a week now since my partner has completely withdrawn for want of being alone how can i cope with the anxiety of this i havent managed to put together professional help yet such as therapy but i have been looking into it it is going to take time and effort of course which is even more difficult and frightening to do without some type of support

in the meantime i need something anything i am so lonely so alone with my depression and anxieties how to keep the thoughts from overwhelming me constantly even when i try to occupy myself any suggestions on where else to go to for longer term support preferably someone i can talk with that understands and can potentially share similar experiences or simply provide any comfort on the situation

i apologize for all these questions feel free to pick whichever you think you can answer thank you to anyone who read all of this and to anyone who responds

tldr im having a very significant struggle with my currently codependent relationship with my romantic partner where he is the giver and i am the taker often times my partner in his own depression struggled to shoulder my burdens i was selfish and couldnt stop myself from unloading everything on him now he is so overwhelmed by it all that he is considering going back into selfisolation essentially leaving me

he loves me deeply too but he says he cannot provide for me what i deserve i fear he has lost sight of how good love can be that our love is more harmful than good

we are in a longdistance relationship so being physically together to talk sadly is not an option

how do i manage my anxiety in not knowing what is going to happen in his absence how do i cope with these overwhelming constant thoughts and loneliness that it consumes me every day",1
"is there any point in attempting to navigate the health care system anymore   i was making lunch and my heart started racing out of nowhere i believed i was having a heart attack so i went to the doctor apparently my thyroid levels are high but when they sent me home with metoprolol it happened again i went back to the hospital and doctor told me its anxiety attacks

so the hospital sends me to mental health urgent care mental health urgent care told me i need to get a referral from the doctor the doctor told me i need to go to the mental health clinic the mental health clinic say i need to talk to the doctor the doctor says go back to the clinic

that statement often holds true for both positive and negative aspects of life its often framed as the law of attraction or the selffulfilling prophecy essentially what you focus on tends to expand in your awareness and experience  
for example if you constantly focus on negative thoughts or outcomes you may start noticing more negativity around you which can reinforce your beliefs and attitudes on the other hand if you focus on positive aspects of life and cultivate a positive mindset youre more likely to notice and attract positive experiences and opportunities  
this phenomenon is not solely based on wishful thinking but also on how our brains are wired to perceive and interpret the world around us our beliefs and attitudes shape our perceptions and behaviors influencing what we pay attention to and how we respond to situations  
therefore being mindful of your thoughts and intentionally directing your focus towards the positive can have a significant impact on your overall wellbeing and the outcomes you experience in life",1

my problem is my anxiety is taking over my whole life i keep feeling random abdominal pains now but also have a lot of diarrhea i know it is most likely just from having such intense anxiety but i don’t know how to calm myself down no family history of colon cancer but it feels like everywhere i read i see posts about someone being diagnosed hoping someone can help

today when i picked it up the pharmacist said to take it at night due to it causing drowsiness

"im struggling mentally every single day over anxiety and past regrets sorry if this is long i thought the length was needed to explain the story fully

i had an abusive sibling who tormented me for many years growing up all until my university years im a passive individual so i let him step all over me and he wouldnt leave me alone ever it was extremely frustrating getting treated like i was inhumane for 5 years eg getting my door kicked in cussed out regularly and ridiculed over everything what ended up stopping this abuse was a hostile confrontation  moving my room to the basement

  

since then that person left me alone but im still so uncomfortable every day those with anxiety should understand its a chronic worry that doesnt make sense even though i fixed the problem im still haunted by regular thoughts so frequently such as hes about to kick my door and jump scare me hes going to talk down on me when i do this etc

  

i have so many regrets for example

 im based in canada i think about the fact i shouldve applied for us rolesaccepted my us interviews so i would be in the us instead of living in this traumatic environment every day
 i shouldve moved out for university for a better gpa instead of letting my anxiety cripple me at home but my parents wouldnt help me out financially and when i had the means to move out i was hesitant to waste money since i grew up poor

  

ive received past suggestions regarding moving out but a couple of things

 i grew up poor how can i justify wasting money like that my mental health already suffered through university so i might as well keep going since i can tolerate university which was way more difficult
 also despite the fact i feel my parents neglected me i still love them theyre getting older and i think down the road ill regret not spending more time with them if my job is remote why would i move out

  

things tried

 ive gone to therapy for 1 year and i didnt find it too helpful ill probably try again soon im hesitant to take medication though i understand the scientific benefits its just that i believe i can fix myself without it and i dont want to be exposed to side effects unnecessarily
 getting advice from a trusted friend ive asked other friends before as well and their advice was just to move out

"has anyone else here felt this way about death  i know it’s not uncommon to fear death but it’s starting to get a little out of hand this has been on and off for the past year or so ever since i reached my 30s i’ve always been afraid of death but not to this extent 

i think what triggered this might’ve been a couple things losing my grandpa who was the last grandparent i had who was still alive and hearing my nephew call my parents “grandma and grandpa” the second part sounds silly but that makes me think of my grandparents and how fast time went by i don’t see my nephew a lot and heard him say those things a lot in a small amount of time when we went on a family vacation 

other things seem to trigger it too recently on social media i saw that someone i used to work with lost their spouse and they’re both in their 30s i saw someone post a picture of what looked to be their grandpa holding their grandma’s hand on her death bed i maintenance accounts of people who died from time to time at work i love my job don’t get me wrong 

i hate how final death and getting older are i don’t understand how anyone can accept death as a natural part of life it’s weird to think of anyone no longer existing i’m terrified to lose anyone for awhile i didn’t want to get a pet mostly because i didn’t want to eventually lose them i’m terrified something will happen to my fiancé i hate the unknown

"how do i detach i’m a 25 year old female my parents have always had a very unstable relationship i have an older sister and younger brother and there have always been arguments in our house to the extent that there has been a period of several years where my parents lived under the same roof with us but never spoke a word to each other 

i’m sure my father is a narcissist but he’s the worst kind he’s educated and very manipulative my mother and father are a match made in hell he’s an extreme taker and she’s an extreme giver for years she’s let him walk all over her and still babied him and catered to his every need i resent her for that because she never gets anything she wants or needs for her own peace even just a clean house he’s a hoarder and his stuff is filled in a lot of the rooms in our house he’s selfish and if you tell him something bothers you he will start doing it on purpose my mother never holds anger and she forgets everything he does to her she keeps saying she needs to treat him like a mental patient but he’s not because he’s actively making these evil decisions and on top of that claims he’s highly religious when i know atheists who are much better people than him in terms of being a good person my mother my siblings and i have grown up with this and it’s really affecting me now because i’ve only recently come to these realisations and now i see everything tiny thing wrong and manipulation i’m the only sibling that still lived at home until now and things keep getting worse i haven’t spoken to my dad for a year and earlier this year my mum blamed me for something it was later proven i didn’t do she swore at me for an hour i said nothing and then she abandoned me for a months and didn’t speak to me this year she’s started doing that more and more and i told her i wouldn’t speak to her without therapy because she keeps betraying me then abandoning me for weeks but she is fine with it she can go weeks without speaking to me and her life goes on as normal but for me that’s all i think about i can’t concentrate on work or anything else because i’m attached but she’s not my siblings aren’t like this it’s gotten to the point where the therapist has told me to get her to write her commitments on paper with a signature so she can be held somewhat accountable i feel like she is taking the frustrations of her marriage out on me subconsciously but i feel bad for her because most of the time she doesn’t even know she’s being manipulated by my dad and she realised it when i point it out to her it’s gotten so bad that all of my family have decided to make me the trauma dump they hurt me and then when they push me past my limit and finally react they make me the problem and after a year i’ve finally given them the excuses they need to make me the problem 

i’m just confused why i don’t want to move out like my other siblings i’m pathetic and keep worrying about my mum when all she and anyone else ever do for me is performative why do i care that my mum is getting older and i want to spend time with her why do i have these weird anxieties and start to panic that me leaving home will give my mum more grief and speed her ageing and the next time i see her she won’t look the same why have i got abandonment issues and why am i needing her so much why does it hurt me to leave her even though she’ll abuse me even though i’m living under the mercy of them my gp told me my parents are taking up a lot of the venn diagram of my life he used the analogy of lisa  homer from the simpsons saying you need to realise how much someone can give you i realise that i’ll never have the relationship with my parents that i want but what bothers me is that if they cared they wouldn’t abandon me for months i wouldn’t do that to my mum my gp says i need to find myself and live my own life but that won’t make me happy if my mum isn’t happy i can’t be happy without her  family is the one thing that if i had if i had some stability in my family i would be happy i could be unemployed no money no friends but if my family was happy then i’d be completely content i think that’s why god is testing me with this because he knows it’s a test that will really get to me recently things have gotten so bad because i finally reacted not only can i not sleep at night from the guilt of my reaction which wasn’t bad and my family have done worse but i have a years worth of resentment towards my family for finally making me the problem i know i’m in control of my own reactions but i can only take so much repetitive hurtful behaviour that has been discussed endlessly and that i’ve spent months trying to explain in a way that she will understand but no matter how much factual evidence i have that they and she do not care about me my mother says that’s all it’s all in my head obviously i will think you’re doing it purposefully to hurt me but i still need your validation she leaves in the middle of our conversations on purpose i know i’m not supposed to get closure from others but no one is letting me heal they keep stabbing my open wound that’s what it feels like then they expect me to believe when they say they care when their actions show the opposite and they have successfully made me the issue because i finally have in and reacted how do i detach i can’t go into detail but recently an incident occurred and it was turned on me when i was the one who got hurt and asked for help they both lied and these lies have been recorded forever and that hurts a lot but i’m pathetic and still want to go back home i have financial goals and they know this and if i try and go back home they will put conditions on me and blackmail me to even let me enter i always defend my mum but she betrayed me and teamed up with my dad but my dad wins either way he knows if i come home he can and will blackmail me to do things his way and he knows i want to stay home because i have financial goals and if i don’t come home he’s stopping me from getting there it’s only me that ever loses anything and i’ve lost the most this year not due to any of my own actions but because of me finally reacting to their hurtful actions they don’t care how much i lose they still want to see me in pain even when my mum admits what she did was hurtful after i question her she asks me what i want like i’m the issue never once does anyone voluntarily apologise or voluntarily say i won’t do that thing that hurt you again why do i need them to say this why do i need my mum to say this why am i not comfortable being misunderstood how do i detach too much context is missing and you might be inclined to say i’m sensitive or need to grow up or take any side but mine but imagine if my parents did something that would affect my life forever and it was not me who caused this but they lied and were believed and it will affect my future but not theirs though they were the abusers only i lose it’s only ever a lose lose for me be abused and hurt or leave or distance myself and feel guilty and miserably unhappy how am i supposed to feel and act therapy isn’t helping quick enough how do i detach",1

any tips words of support would appreciate it thank you

the oldest child is always the most cared and most protected child of a couple when the second child is born in a time when the oldest child is growing physically and mentally being more aware of their surroundings and being guided by their curiosity the child stops having that attention and protection from their parents they become more independent and in order to protect themselves from the environment the brain used to being protected and not having to worry about much starts triggering the fight or flight response more often phobias and other fears start appearing that can later lead to an anxiety disorder",1

lack of motivation a lack of motivation may be attributed to an absence of obligations to entities and people like school work friends and volunteering a lack of motivation comes from not knowing or looking at your goals daily reflecting on what you want to accomplish and ignoring potential regrets associated with missed opportunities and fears,1
"im confused and hurt i 24f have been in and out of depression for years my dad would always be the one to help me and support me and unfortunately i lost my dad 2 months ago it really hasnt been easy and feels like its getting worse 
recently my mom walked in on me crying and said absolutely nothing
its not the first time either its happened a lot over the years
shed just look at me and go about her business

ive asked her about it and all she says is she doesnt know what to do when people cry

i dont have anyone close enough to ask or speak about this with nor do i know if im in the right place

but im just wondering if its normal thing and quite honestly i dont know what to feel towards it",1
"been really depressed for 2 years but my parents don’t really know anything tw ed sewerside sh mentions

this is going to sound kinda stupid because i am only an 8th grader but for the past year or twoish i’ve been struggling a lot with my eating and mental health my mom and dad think that i’m just their perfectly perfect daughter who gets straight a’s and plays soccer and always seems “happy” i’ve been pretty suicidal and have purposely hurt myself a few times in these last years and even hope to not wake up some nights plus i get lots of anxiety in public and at school but i have no clue how to tell my parents because i know they’d freak

right after my parents divorced in 6th grade i sorta felt nothing empty no matter what i seemed to do i didn’t care all i ever wanted to do was go on my phone at my dad’s since there was literally nothing to do in his small apartment and my mom had a boyfriend over all the time who i hated so basically no matter where i was i hated it hated school and home i hadn’t cried for almost a year after they separated because i felt as if they had been all used up then an ed started which made my brain only think worser things

this last summer i told my mom that i had bulimia she almost cried and blamed it on herself because of the divorce it really wasn’t her fault at all and it made me feel even worse not to mention that she told everyone i knew which made it super awkward around family and close friends and i had to spend half of my summer going through a bunch of recovery stuff that didn’t rly help

god it hurts sometimes to even think about what i used to go through and i really want to get some help with this depression stuff i just don’t want all of that to happen again and don’t want to hurt my mom either any advice",1
"what is this feeling i’m feeling so i have never been diagnosed by a professional but always knew i had some kind of anxiety but that is a long story so will skip  

recently i met my boyfriendof 4 months‘s best friends it was two of his guy friends and their significant others we went to dinner which was okay and then to karaoke i don’t like karaoke and my bf let me know if i didn’t want to go i didn’t have to well i didn’t want to be a party pooper so i followed 

as soon as i entered the room i knew i made a mistake… initially i was alright but the longer i stayed i got so uncomfortable and i was doubting everything even my relationship obviously my bf acts lil different when he is with me alone so that also added to that i felt detached from reality and i think i had a minor panic attack i no longer was able to put on a straight face

after that it hasn’t been the same

i was depressed and wasn’t feeling the same towards my bf but we met up and made up it’s been a month now and here i am again not feeling great i was in bed all day yesterday and not answering my bf texts we video called but i was so cold to him and couldn’t tell him i loved him i wasn’t feeling it

i know i deeply care about him and he is the sweetest person and treats me so well i don’t know why i’m treating him the opposite way even at work today my heart rate was going up and felt uneasy ",1
"every obstacle sometimes it seems like every obstacle no matter how minor  brings with a sting of anxiety that feels almost as if my brain is wincing or closing its eyes so to speak i feel like the hardest part of anxiety is figuring out how to open back up to the present moment and to other thoughts or topics that dont involve dont fuck this up 

its not that i feel that way all the time so much as this feeling flashes quite frequently as if it were grabbing and yanking the steering wheel so to speak

i also have adhd and i wonder if that makes the anxiety manifest differently does any of this make sense is this how anxiety manifests in others if so what have you found helps",1
"phrase we are not our thoughts caused me slight dissociation  asking for help i have been reading about this concept and it has only caused me pain so if if i think about how much i like certain song then its a lie things i enjoy immensely always find a way to transfer from my emotions to my thoughts and i always found it helpful towards the journey of self discovery we have so many complex systems that work as one whole now tell me how does that not shape or personality and who we are so every single thing that my thoughts tell me i enjoy is a lie every observation i have in the outside world where i meet a random person and i like them and i think to myself that i really do like them then everything i think to myself in any kind of a situation is false and it has nothing to do with me even the way we write what we write about has traces of our personality  and it comes from our thoughts i find it impossible to believe that our thoughts are not connected to our personality in any way in a lot of ways they guide us towards her interests our hobbies our relationships so how can none of it be apart of who we are can someone tell me that some of our some of our thoughts are apart of our personality because now i feel my interests are meaningless my relationships are meaningless my taste in anything i like is meaningless because anything my thoughts tell me i like is apparently false and and tells us nothing about ourselves ill give you an example i see something i like then i have a thought that the thing i see looks amazing and then that same thought produces an emotion that makes me feel good and at the same time i discover what i like so tell me how how the thoughts we have are not stepping stones towards ourselves  
  
i see a point in not identifying with our bad or intrusive thoughts as a part of selfhelp when your in therapy but we shouldnt discredit all our thoughts as a part of ourselves they play an important part in forming our identity just as our feelings and behavior they are all interconnected  
  
why the phrase lacks logic  
○ before your discovered your interests and hobbies you had an emotional feeling about a particular thing then thought to yourself i really like this i want to do it again the emotion got translated into your thought  some parts of your thoughts helped you find your likesdislikes and are as such  a part of you  
○ before you do most of the things in everyday life  whether make a new friend call your current friend make food that you find tasty what do you do you think about how good it tasted in the past and that you want to make it again your thoughts were again apart of you and what you like  
○ when you search for a new job and you want to find something thats aligned with your own desires and wishes what do you do you think about it and based on the thoughts and the ones youll listen to the ones you follow and are again apart of you and your personality will play a huge role in your life direction  
○ through a psychological test where students wrote random thoughts on a piece of paper psychologists acquired many traces of their personality  just based off that and it was mostly accurate  
○ we are not all of our thoughts but many of our thoughts tell us about who who we actually arethey help us discover about or wantspreferences about what we dont want and so much  
○ where we currently are in life is a place where we travelled to based on the thoughts we chose to work with  
○ personality is a pattern of thought feeling and behavior but little attention has been paid to thoughts  john a johnson phd a professor of psychology at pennsylvania state university  
○ a new person we like and speak to regularly makes us feel a certain type of way  then that emotion gets transferred to our thoughts i want to go out with this person they make me feel good about myself i like how many simillar things we share  based on our thinking we pursue that interest  
  
i just think that quote is false has some truth in when it comes to selfhelp or bad thoughts but is not entirely right  at the same time it causes me agony and that thoughts emotions and genetics are one of many parts that make us who we are we have thoughts about our interests likes our love lives if we didnt follow up with any of our thoughts we wouldnt develop any of the things i just mentioned  
my opinion is also based on research is that some of our thoughts tell us nothing of ourselves and are indeed intrusive and cause nothing but harm but a lot of them are connected to our emotions our personalitypersonal tastes our inner drives and play an equal role as many other things emotions genetics family cirmustances etc that play a role and give shape to what we are  
  
quotes from different internet sources personalities contain the patterns of your thoughts feelings and behaviors that make each person unique together these aspects can play a role in every part of our lives from friendships to careers to hobbies thoughts the neglected aspect of personality personality is a pattern of thought feeling and behavior but little attention has been paid to thoughts the point is that all three aspects of what textbook author david funder 2019 called the psychological triad—thoughts feelings and behavior—are equally important  john a johnson phd professor of psychology thoughts are ideas perspectives opinions and beliefs that influence our emotions actions and habits they can be positive or negative and they play a significant role in shaping our personality  
  
i am talking about this subject from a psychologicalscientific point of view not from any kind of spiritualphilosophical way of thinking  
  
are some of our thoughts part of our personality our genetic makeup and our nature do they play a role in shaping personality do they tell us something about our values beliefs and bottom line ourselves i feel like thoughtsthought patterns emotions genetics etc all play equal role in shaping who we are our personality

tldr not sure whether to go on road trip witu bf or not because of instrusive thoughts of harming myself during car ride leaving in 4 weeks

hey everyone me f24 and my boyfriend m24 are together for a few years now living together 2 years

i have severe agoraphobia i am housebound not able to work my boyfriend is basically a full time 247 care giver since i had to wait for therapytreatment for so long i am not able to alone either yes i am very ashamed of this

on the other hand i can do a lot as long as my boyfriend is with me 

last year i went on an 15hr road trip to another country and i had a good time even though i had anxious moments
i enjoyed my trip a lot and have great memories



this year we are planning to go on holiday and do another road trip of roughly 16hrs to a new country this is his dream vacation to go wild camping and just be in the mountains hiking the plan is to stay for around 14 days

if not for my anxiety id love this too but because of the anxiety i am not even looking forward to it anymore otherwise i would have loved it

i just struggle with panic disorder agoraphobia and a lot of intrusive thoughts

the thing that i am dreading the most is the car ride over the free way i have meds that dont allow me to drive 

my biggest instrusive thought is to just jump out of the car whilst he is driving on the freeway this is i think the most important concerns 

just to be clear no i have no history of doing things like that nor do i wish to do something like that i nevet self harmed or did an unaliving attempt 

other concerns
 not being able to go at all and thus to disappointing my boyfriend damaging our relationship we saved up big for the vacation
 being anxious all the time and having panic attacks all throughout the trip
 wanting to go back but not being able to since i can not drive or travel alone due anxietyagoraphobia
 something happening to him and being alone in a strange country
 struggling with my biggest instrusive thought of losing control in a panic attack and jumping out of the car on the high way
 not enjoying the holiday because of anxiety and ruining it
 we are camping in the wild my first time so i will have a lot of time to think and worry about everything


on the other hand my boyfriend reassured me that we can go home if we really need to and that he will pull over if he can do it safely if i ever really feel like i am losing it

just the fact that i am so discouraged to go i have no faith in myself at all makes me wonder should i go at all

i had a good experience last year with the same kind of trip and yes my intrusive thoughts were also a big part of it but i realise i will have to go thtough it again if i go

please help
 should i go and how do i deal with that stubborn intrusive thought

thank you for reading any advice is welcome ❤️

"its becoming increasingly difficult to function im starting to notice that my anxiety and depression are interfering with my work and relationship 

i havent felt happy for quite some time now and its becoming increasingly difficult to handle work properly i honestly feel tired all the time due to me constantly worrying about something andor many things 

lately with nearly anything my partner says to me i just pick it apart thinking there is something more to what they just told me that or ill get sad over it due to what i think is insecurity they said to me today that they are going to start watching what they say to me because of my reactions lately which honestly only makes me feel worse

im currently looking for insurance to speak to a professional and probably get on medication but im currently working two jobs with income tight enough as it is i have no doubt that this all work and no play is most likely the main cause for my behavior lately but i started meditating again about a 15 weeks ago and i picked up smoking marijuana again with hopes that it would help to calm my nerves sometimes the nerves are still there internally theyre just not nearly as expressed externally —but not always 100 so in a way the meditation and marijuana are helping

but in the meantime i really dont like that my partner feels the way they do and that im the cause of it it honestly makes me not want them to be a part of my life right now until i can get this all figured out i dont really want to talk to them anyway for fear of my reaction to anything they say and i dont want them to be placed in such a position for them to constantly walk on eggshells 

im starting to feel like a notsogood human being and the voices are getting darker my partner is trying their absolute best to stay calm patient supportive comforting and strong but i know first hand how difficult it can be to try and be there for someone that is pretty depressed and has such high anxiety and i really dont think i want to continue to put them through that

"do you have any tips to deal with intense bodily anxiety i’ve 22f battled with anxiety my entire life and i’ve been very lucky to have parents who support me and got me into therapy in my early teens this means i’ve been given a lot of resources that have taught me to handle my emotions and thoughts throughout the years and i’m in a much better place than i was in the past

obviously i still have anxiety at times especially when it comes to social stuff exams and leaving home the issue is that while i’ve learnt to quiet down my head and distract myself i still feel such a physical anxiety that i can’t live in my own body
it’s like my head and body have two minds of their own and while i can be calm and rational in my head my body will be giving me a terrible heart ache the shakes foggy headaches trouble breathing and a deep pit in my stomach

i’ve picked up running again recently because i have an exam coming up but it only helps while i’m running and the moment i get back home i’ll be back to anxiety city within 20 min

idk it’s just rly upsetting to feel like i have my head figured out to a degree but then my body still reacts to some subconscious thoughts that i can’t control or even hear whatsoever

do any of you guys have experience with this or can you relate any tips i’ve considered asking my doctor about beta blockers cause my anxiety has been the reason i’ve failed exams in my adult life but idk… maybe i should go back to therapy  it’s just so expensive

ended up crashing on 2 of my “friends” couch first month there my car tire blew out so i my savings i would’ve needed to help them pay for rent had to go towards roadside assistance and a new tire even though i know the frustration of late payments i’d think my “friends” would understand that i wasn’t just trying to play them instead one of my friends in particular gave me shit and told our other friends that i’m just not paying rent having them come after me too… on top of him constantly making it known to me how he doesn’t want me there but i guess he can treat me any way he wishes because “he lets me live there” right 

i would’ve left months ago but my credit got so bad trying to repay the loans after the eviction with me and my mom that i can’t find a new place because they have a certain credit score requirement so i’m stuck in an environment where i’m constantly reminded how unwanted i am with my only other possible option being to sleep in my car for months until i get my credit up

"how to stop blaming myself for doing what’s society considers to be “the bare minimum” i’m 26 female i have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety and leaving the house by myself and running errands and doing “normal adult stuff” feels like i’m going to war the fear of being scrutinized and not acting like a normal adult who knows what they’re doing 

i’m aware that nobody knows what they’re doing but some people sure appear as if they do i had an interesting conversation with someone who told me that for some people leaving the bed is reason to celebrate and i know that and would never shame someone with depressionfor example for failing to get out of bed

and yet when my husband says he’s proud of me for catching 2 ubers and going to run errands by myself which is incredibly anxiety inducing i’m like “yeah congratulations you’ve done the bare minimum” i feel like i shouldn’t be congratulated for something so simple that i was supposed to do effortlessly 

maybe just maybe this has to do with my dad saying stuff like “how come you don’t know how to do xyz” or “how come you don’t know how to go from x to y” as i was growing up growing up i always had him and my mom take me places they both had cars and were always available i grew up hearing people call me an airhead i rarely had to walk to and fro i’ve developed a severe fear of crossing the street as a result and have a terrible sense of direction 

i believe this also has to do with many people jokingly asking me if i have mental issues for example this one time a guy asked me if i had mental issues when i didn’t know the neighborhood we were in because apparently it was obvious this stuff makes me feel like i should know this stuff and shouldn’t be congratulated if i get it right

this makes me extremely ashamed of myself


my mother calls this pride someone on social anxiety subreddit once told me to “kill my ego” when i told them that i didn’t want to ask for help at the gym for the fear of sounding stupid and i’m worried that i’m not anxious but proud and egocentric and if that’s true i would appreciate any advice i want to better myself",1

"do you ever feel like the dumbest person alive i was a gifted kid i would bury myself in my studies get straight as and be the first one to answer questions in class everyone would want to copy my homework and during group work no one in my group would be productive because they knew i would do all the work anyway my entire life i equated how i did in school with how smart i was

then i graduated university

suddenly there were no more grades there were no more classes i had to make or books i had to read no more helping others with their schoolwork reading over essays hundreds of times to catch any and every mistake or leading group discussions about academic topics i had no way to measure my intelligence anymore

its been 2 years since i graduated and i cant stop feeling dumb i constantly feel like my friends and family members are talking down to me i always regret voicing my opinions because i feel stupid afterwards if my perspective doesnt align with someone elses i assume theyre right and im wrong—or just an idiot i dont take risks in fear that i will fail i downplay my education and experience and never ask to be compensated for what im worth every time anyone has a different opinion than mine i want to breakdown because i shouldnt have said anything in the first place

i believe i am so unintelligent that i will never make it anywhere in life its effecting my ability to find a better job practice mindfulness and have motivation to do anything even if its something simple like cleaning my room or something fun like a hobby or interest

"work making me anxious i have some anxiety particularly around work i work as a tour guide which is a weird choice because in my life im very introverted and would prefer to remain anonymous however the money is good and it is all things considered an easy gig

anyhow i got caught talking to guests today and didnt clear out of the tour end room another guide ran into me i apologized later i sent a text also apologizing and he just told me what to do better next time

this is all to say  it all made me super anxious so anxious that i spiraled a bit and then got into a bit of a tiff with my partner

why do i ghost people i get easily overwhelmed and ill ghost friends ive made on the internet for no reason other than i feel like theyre getting close to me and i feel like im scared of emotional intimacy but i want friendship i just feel like if i let people get too close they wont like me at all and leave me so i leave then first or worse theyll abuse me emotionally or verbally and i just get terrified by the thought,1
"so expensive to live i dont even know what to say i dont know how anyone is okay with the prices of things today i am at my witts end it should not cost this much to stay alive i am 21 my sibling is 29 our mom just passed away so we are experiencing living on our own for the first time not to say we didnt experience hardship while our mother was here but now it is on a different level i want to preface this by saying we were raised very well we do not drink we do not smoke we are homebody gamers who occasionally like to buy pizza

we had to move because the home we occupied was way too big for 2 people and we by ourselves wouldnt have been able to afford it but even downsizing hasnt changed anything we have 2 cars so we have car payments but now we find out it is 700 to fill the propane tanks for heat and they are saying that you fill it about once every month we have to pay our lot rent which is 430 plus when we moved in here we noticed 2 weeks in that they had mice so we had to have terminix come out which is 1200 that we are paying in increments we just went food shopping for necessities we paid 300 plus all your other bits and bobs electric phone bills gas money etc  i am ready to sit in a corner and rot away 

and before the people come attacking about how we just need better jobs get up and hustle we both work 40 hours a week for doctors doing administration work it is by no means a lawyer or doctor type of job but we arent working at a mcdonalds or a low end job we shouldnt need to be engineers and scientists to live a comfortable life i am already dedicating 90 of my life to a job and the people saying go get a part time job too are crazy we shouldnt need to we are living to work and are still barely making it how is hustle culture normalized why are we okay struggling and blaming ourselves",1

"bidude confessed to a straight friend i recently confessed my feelings to my straight friend a few days ago he was unfazed when i came out to him about my orientation beginning of april like ok cool i tried to hide the feelings but it was eating me as i try to pull this facade i know it wont be reciprocated which is totally understandable eventually it has taken so much toll on my health overall that i had no other choice but just to tell him

i couldnt help not to overworry and overthink worst case scenarios i tried to call him first but i ended up just sending short voice messages instead since he couldnt pick up the phone then he texted that he is sorry for being super unavailable for theres a lot that has been going on with him and that he will talk to me in a bit i assume he hasnt listened to the audios we also didnt get to talk or anything so far

i am aware i have to give him space but the fear of the unknown with me having general anxiety disorder arent helping we are still friends on ig or he still follows me but he was never a social media person 

i am worried for myself that ill be feeling hurt for the next couple of days and maybe give him a week or so to respond maybe but i know ill probably be the one to reach out to at least ask him how is he

i mean he is an honest dude we had a great 3hr chat on our first hang out and we ended up hanging out as much as possible he told me his work  school schedule when he is free even told me weeks ago that there has been a lot of work problems on his end that drains the crap out of him so it is an open  honest friendshipcommunication ever since

i am not sure if im looking for validation comfort or the harsh possibility yet i am still hopeful for the better of our friendship

panic  anxiety attacks  for a week how can i handle this  ,1
"how to stop overthinking my social life i recently left a longterm relationship of five years the relationship was what youd call codependent i have a history of forming a very strong bond with one person and depending on them for the majority of my social needs now is the first in a very long time that i find myself without one special person to depend on

my whole life ive been told that i need to broaden my relationships be less exclusive and expand my social circle and i actually have more friends than ive ever had now a handful id consider pretty close to me but my problem is that i cant stop overanalysing and worrying about everything to do with my social life

im acutely aware of any sign that my relationships arent as close as i want them to be i sacrifice any and all personal responsibilities to hang out with friends terrified that if i dont accept an invite ill lose them or theyll all bond without me im painfully insecure anytime a friend mocks me i cant help but deeply internalise their observations im wounded by any suggestion that my friends like each other or are closer than they are with me i worry constantly about losing my friendships and about what people think of me i feel like an alien from another planet i havent had proper friends in so long that i dont even know whats normal or how to behave around them all this anxiety about my social life is destroying me mentally and physically as well as negatively affecting my productivity and relationships i quite literally feel like im going crazy

im seeking therapy for all of this but in the meantime id love to hear any advice about how to manage this deep insecurity and fear even just some solidarity would do me good at this point

hi everyone im currently a trainee cbt therapist at a facility im looking for more practice outside of work so i can get more experienced and confident im wondering if anyone would like to try a few sessions of cbt

my expertise lies in anxiety depression panic disorders and ocd although i’ve started training for ocd cbt is around 56 sessions and it totally depends on your comfortability you can leave anytime i do however need someone who is motivated to change and willing to try out the material as cbt requires some out of session work to do on your own

i know it sounds a bit daunting but the first step to recovery is seeking out help 3 and i’m a nice person who also has anxiety

this would be on google meets voice only or only text if you’re not comfortable although this might not be as effective regardless it will be a safe place for you to be yourself 

edit i’ve got quite a bit of interest on this post which is totally fine i shall organise a wait list and see how many people as i can just drop me a dm on what you’re struggling with just a short summary ",1

"feeling overwhelmed and depressed – need advice hey everyone

i hope youre all doing well im writing this because i dont really know where else to turn and i’m feeling pretty desperate for some advice and support

lately ive been feeling incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out it seems like no matter what i do i can’t shake this constant feeling of anxiety and depression ive been struggling to keep up with my responsibilities both at work and in my personal life and it’s all starting to take a serious toll on my mental health

to give some context im balancing multiple demanding projects at work while also trying to find a new job the pressure to succeed is immense and im constantly worried about failing or not being good enough my perfectionism only makes things worse as i often feel like i need to excel in everything i do

on top of all this i’m trying to learn new skills and grow professionally which adds another layer of stress it feels like there’s always something more to do and never enough time to do it the weight of all these responsibilities is just so heavy

i don’t have many people to talk to about how i’m feeling it’s hard to open up about just how much i’m struggling right now im finding it hard to sleep my appetite is all over the place and i feel like im on the verge of a breakdown i try to take breaks and practice selfcare but it never feels like enough the feelings of hopelessness are overwhelming

has anyone else been in a similar situation how did you cope with the overwhelming stress and feelings of depression are there any techniques or strategies that helped you find some balance and peace i would really appreciate any advice or words of encouragement thanks for reading",1

"my mom has anxiety and her way of dealing with is to drive me crazy as the title suggests a little premise i have autism
my mother has severe anxiety disorder which is mainly because on the same day she received the college admission letter her father told her that he had been cheating and that he was going to divorce now my mother has had severe anxiety symptoms since then because she felt that she had not done well enough to cause all this but she was a straight a student
but since i was born she seemed to be used to putting pressure on me she was worried that i would fail take drugs and become an underage mother because she was a high school teacher and had seen too many such things
before i went to junior high school she never allowed me to watch tv for more than half an hour a week or play computer games in fact it drove me crazy in the end i stood on the balcony of the school and threatened her not to say it again otherwise i would obviously the situation got worse she began to not allow me to talk to my friends unless she was sure that the friend was a good person
i have been in college but obviously the situation has not improved she called me five times a day and kept asking me to report the situation i would go home for winter and summer vacations and she would force me to show her my grades if my grades were not ideal she would keep scolding me
last time she drove me crazy because she kept nagging me about how i wasnt trying hard enough even though we just wanted to go to the movies so i tried to take her to the doctor but she just realized her problem and said she actually knew i was trying my best but she couldnt change any suggestions",1
"what the hell is happening hi guys…long one
i have been dealing with something i know is common but want some tipsfeedback i’m 51 and have been a high school teacher for 23 years and have always looooved it…always considered one of the best civics teachers in my county even state however last september my dad died at 70 of cancer that he had been diagnosed with only a few months before i lived with him and had a great relationship etc and was the one who did everything for him grief is a mothertrucker i lost my mom 20 yrs ago that was very sudden and really sucked because we were very close…so i am chock full of the grief coping mechanisms and all that jazz 
after he died i just stopped feeling like being at work literally stopped feeling like going i loved my students loved my co workers  there was so much support i could never pinpoint why i have been on meds wellbutrin and lamical xanax when needed since i was 21 but absolutely nothing made me feel like doing a damn thing i switched schools to get a fresh reset but the same thing has been happening this year to the point of embarassment but with the added bonus of getting anxiety about lesson planning i burned through my leave and get leave without pay whenever i am out even that hasn’t made me get it together i’m having that fun paralysis with most everything i love crafty stuff i have wanted to get a second master’s or go to law school or even take a friggin spanish class i love school nope anxiety attack even considering doing anything like that i cannot pull it together to clean up my house and can stand in the living room staring at everything simply thinking for like a half an hour of how bad i need to clean etc 
when i actually go to work i love my kids love my co workers love my subject but i have taught basically nothing because of that odd anxiety attack thing about lesson planning i am a very popular teacher and have been open and honest with my students about these struggles i don’t necessarily want to be out of the classroom
but dammit what the heck i added lexapro to the cocktail and that was a bad move so i switched to adding pristiq last week hoping that will help pull me up

"im so broken how do you think coworkers perceive me im in my 30s and recently began a job at a coffee shop chain and i just am curious how my coworkers perceive me or think of me

for one im currently going through some very painful things definitely the toughest time of my life

along with that im very guarded and never talk unless someone approaches me i dont talk about my personal life and dont ask about anyones personal life

i was a very slow learner when beginning this job and still am its a very easy job not a lot to it but i still struggle and often get easily overwhelmed when talking to lots of customers

also when theres a lot of people in the store i am very quiet and dont project my voice oftentimes when im talking it sounds loud to me but im sure its just like basically a whisper to others

and by the end of my 8 hour shift i probably seem halfretarded or something due to overstimulation right before i left yesterday my manager was talking to me about closing procedures and i was just gazing at the floor when i began saying thank you and i show no emotion on my face at all and probably seem like something is wrong with me

truth is im nothing like this outside of work im lively fun laid back free and at peace but i am deeply reserved and guarded and also get very overstimulated at work so i seem mentally challenged or something

however i am a good looking dude for what its worth i am always polite and kind gentle and meek i never gossip if people talk to me about music ill talk to them or other casual topics but mostly im very guarded outside of that

"is this a sign of anxiety   j i have been struggling with unwanted intrusive thoughts for as long as i can remember they can be very debilitating as they have major control over me and can control my actions the thoughts are thoughts like “if i don’t try phone my bf on his way home from work something bad will happen”  or like “i’m not allowed to play certain songs that say certain things in them or something bad will happen to me” these are just 2 of the very many thoughts i have and struggle with on a daily basis i find that i can’t just “stop giving into the thought” and it has a complete hold of me if i don’t perform the compulsion attached to these thoughts then the distress and anxiety i am left with is crippling and absolutely horrible to deal with it feels like there is no way out of it i have to do these thoughts or it will mean that there will be bad consequences

"trauma response to minor inconveniences the past couple of years have been horrendous for me my father passed away in july after a very horrible battle with alcoholism and i left my partner of 6 years in may because they were just incredibly unsupportive and very draining the year before that my grandmother passed after having essentially given up and refused to eatdrink 

i moved back in with my mum last may and were practically living in a barbie dream house together we are so happy vibing together and finally everything is good for us we can talk about everything that weve been through and are incredibly supportive of each other 

the problem im currently experiencing is a physiological response to minor inconveniences and ill do my best to explain what i mean

after everything weve endured things are finally calm and safe but it took me a while to get here for the first couple of months after i moved back in with mum i realised that i had all these triggers my ex had instilled in me but i overcame them and thats great it took a very steady decline from heightened levels of anxiety to get to where i am now

however im finding that very small inconveniences are triggering quite a severe physical stress response for example my dog getting slightly sick or my car breaking down i can rationalise these in my head and recognise that theyre not a major issue and are nothing i need to really worry about but its as if my body gets a rush of cortisol and i go into mild shock shaking faint racing heart etc and then i cant eat or sleep and feel incredibly nauseous 

its almost as if my body is so conditioned to being in a constant state of stress it doesnt matter that my brain can recognise and rationalise  my body just reacts the way its used to

is that making any sense and if so how do i go about fixing this am i better speaking to a gp about the physiological aspects of whats happening a psychiatrist about what i suspect is a mental disconnection or even both 

id be very grateful to hear if anyone else has experienced this and how they went about resolving it",1

i am so stupid

lia is safe and sound and i cannot wait to go get her",1
"vent about faux pas 
hello i just made this account i currently have no one to vent to and this is a last resort because call lines are useless please feel free to scroll if this is a waste of your time it is a really dumb thing to stress over

i have adhd anxiety social anxiety and depression i am a selfconscious person in my early twenties
i quit a certain green therapy app last fall after almost a year of call sessions because i felt that it wasn’t helping

now i am slowly spiraling again and i just need to vent
i work at a place that involves customer service i visited an institution to read to children it was only my second event but i was anxious and tried to be friendly the first one went okay because i ran into someone i was familiar with but i knew no one in the second event

that day was just not a good day and i think i felt it in my bones
i was sitting with other visitors and was already feeling selfconscious because i had to shimmy out of the cafeteria bench in a long limited dress twice i decided to ask the person in charge a question
it was not my intention to be rude but this faux pas was the tipping point of my mental state this week

i called her “excuse me ms” she didnt respond and was staring down at her clipboard my embarrassment increased and i don’t know why but i tried one more time she was two feet from me
she was moving her lips as if reading and now i was sure she heard me i became mortified as i realized that maybe she thought i was being rude 
so i did what i should’ve done in the first place and i extracted myself from the cafeteria bench and stood in front of her
“sorry excuse me”

after that any emotional preparation for this day went out the window i was a terrible and rude person and now i didn’t know how to function this wasn’t even the beginning of the awkwardness of that day because my embarrassment had increased since the moment i had to ask the security guard to use the bathroom i thought someone was in there and looked dumb because it was a bathroom with stalls inside i seriously thought i heard someone say “busy”

at this point i just didn’t want to start any more awkward interactions my name is hard to pronounce and the event planners were now a few yards away from me further away from the first one i tried to talk to
i decided to throw away some trash quickly before they called me to not keep them waiting however that was a mistake because one of the visitors looked at me in the corner of their eye they also realized that i was needed i noticed the event planner from before was not calling me it’s like she didn’t want to acknowledge me at all now once again i looked rude
when i was processing this they called my last name and i responded

i tried to move on i know i made so many mistakes in an effort to be polite i looked passiveaggressive and rude i know that i didn’t even recount my story properly but i need to vent

i usually speak to a family member about my embarrassing moments but she declined to preserve her own mental health  we have similar issues and agreed on boundaries
another family member always makes my mental health issues about god and another always has to play devil’s advocate i’m not expecting to be coddled but it’s still offputting

"anyone have anxiety about having to go to work in person how do you deal with it i might soon have a new job that requires me to go into the office either full time or hybrid i’ve been working fully  remote for several years now and have loved working remote 

i’ll be honest—i feel very anxious having to go into office every day i just feel a lot of social anxiety and anxiety having to get up each morning and go to a physical workplace i have loved working remote as i feel much calmer and more productive

at an office you have to worry about socializing how you present yourself and all those little annoying things last time i had to go to an office i had trouble sleeping some nights because i just didn’t feel calm 

those who struggle with anxiety—do you work remote or in person  

do you have to go to work in person  

does anyone with anxiety have massive anxiety about having to go to work in person 

have you tried to find a fully remote job instead because of this 

if you have to go work in person how do you deal with the anxiety that comes from that

"paralyzing stress for homework anxiety and depression help please  hi i am in need of some advice 

i am looking for some help on how to start and work on homework homework is a extremely hard task for me and i’ve asked and told multiple irl people about how homework is effecting my life and they continue to give the same advice making me extremely frustrated because most of the advice is coming from people who do not understand what it is like to have depression i do not mean this in a rude way i apologize if it does sound rude 

for me the reason why homework is so hard to do is because i’ve spent multiple long hours on homework i’m a slow worker some of my usual times for homework is up to 4 hours making my life living hell

so because of that i don’t want to even try homework anymore i’ve used to lie more to my parents at the beginning of the year about homework so i wouldn’t get in trouble and then do it at 5 in the morning instead i’ve been trying my best to fix this i know it is not a good way to deal with homework but the anxiety of what they will say and do and the stress of wasting time on insignificant assignments makes my life stressful 

what do i do i can’t continue these patterns it’s not healthy for my mental health",1

when i went back inside and back to my room out of nowhere my stomach started twisting and so i went downstairs to eat something like a small bar and i immediately went to my dad because i felt like i was gonna faint i was having trouble breathing a bit too ever since that happened i have been restless and it’s frustrating me so much because i was able to get good sleep until that very moment

the attack has made me felt like i don’t exist but i know that i exist and for some reason it’s made me do certain things less like eating cause i feel nauseous when i do and im so so so scared i got melatonin to help me sleep but i took it on sunday at 11 pm i fell asleep until 151 am and ive been up since please if someone can help me figure out what happened or if this is normal please tell me because i seriously just want to cry i hate feeling this way and im so scared im gonna feel this way for the rest of my life",1

well i actually stopped seeing the numbers and looking for them and looking signs i think though this is because it didn’t matter i had already made my mind up that it’s real there are too many signs that prove it i have seen several videos about the health thing that causes death that scares me that most with the corresponding number of comments or likes for that day this health thing rarely comes up maybe once or twice a week out of hundred of videos i watch not even that but on day 58 a video had 258 likes and the top comment mentioned it i then looked for more videos with 58 and found one with 58 shares and the guy has it in the video on day 51 another video mentioned it and a comment on that video had 51 likes and his username had a number in it that’s associated with bad things 3 digits i then started looking for videos with 51 and one i landed on had 51 comments and was exactly about what i’m scared of 

this absolutely terrified me and i stopped ever looking after that i have tried blocked it out i’ve tried convincing myself it’s not happening but every time i think about it i see 70 which confirms it’s really there is 9 days left now and i don’t know what to do i’m so scared",1

"a message to my anxiety my traumatised protector and friend trying to keep me safe and carrying so much pain rest easy i’ve been in therapy for a while now and we’ve been working on my relationship towards my anxiety for a good while now but over the past week or so i’ve struggled to find the words for what i’m about to write but the post i made yesterday on radhd has made it click for me so here it is hopefully this way of looking at your anxiety helps someone 

for my whole life i’ve thought of you as a demon a monster that’s come to ruin my life but recently i’ve learned that my younger self the one who went through so much pain and trauma needed me i’ve found him now in the darkness wondering lost and alone and have been giving him the love and care he needs guiding him out and in that experience i also found you there my anxiety you are him you are me

a manifestation of all the pain and anguish i felt back then you are my younger self who has been with me the whole time trying to keep me safe — doing everything you can to prevent me from experiencing new kinds of trauma and pain — and in turn also reaching out for help for someone to help you to accept you and make you whole with me but it’s okay i’m okay now i am safe you have gotten me this far and it’s time for you to rest

when i tell you to stop to “fuck off” or leave me alone you’ve been the one i’ve been talking to all this time my traumatised self looking for help but when i do my grounding techniques when i hug myself i’m also doing that to you to calm you down and put you at ease to let you know that everything’s okay

you must be so confused so hurt so lost you have carried my pain so i wouldn’t have to and have taken on new ones in the process and i’ve shunned you for most of my life but i won’t anymore i accept you as a part of me because you are me

but it’s my turn now to return the favour to keep you safe you are not a separate entity you are my hurt self doing all it can to protect me like an overexcited firefighter tackling fires that don’t exist you must be so tired so so tired

let me carry the pain now i can handle it

i’ll reach out to you when i need you like when i’m nervous about proposing because i know you’ll help me find the motivation to go through it you’ll keep me the excited butterflies and elation when it’s over — you’ve done it before or when there’s actual danger because that’s when i know you’ll keep me safe you’ll heighten my senses you’ll help me think faster and react faster you’ll help me get through it

this isn’t a goodbye this is a change in our relationship this is a change in how i see you i’ll take care of you now i’ll help carry the pain so you can rest easy you don’t have to do it alone anymore

rest easy my anxiety my close friend and protector everything’s going to be okay

stay strong folks you’ve got this",1

"serious my brain and body arent the same anymore 
hey people

i really dont know where to start or how to explain my issues but ill just give it a go because i could really need some help  this post will probably be long so sorry in advance

quick presentation  im a 28 year old guy who just moved to another city to study at university im a sports guy who have always had a love for sports since about 8 years ive been grinding the gym to maybe one day step on a bodybuilding stage hopefully

ive had a rough few years since and during the pandemic when it comes to recovery and stress and even longer before that ive had some issues with other stuff that ill try to describe


so when i was around 19 years old i got diagnosed with ocd my life back then was alot of stress and frustration since my ocd took up alot of time by needing to check the oven doors oven water tap for a few hours a day in total i also had to count to different numbers when it came to checking those things which is extremely tiring and frustrating when doing it day after day months and even years

i started to take meds for depression  ocd for a while but stopped after a few months because it made me feel weird i went to cbt for a while and it helped me with the ocdroutines but the counting and some other stuff are still here to this day

during this period im around 21 in the story now i gained alot of weight like going from fit to overweight maybe i gained around 2025kg fat

i then started to exercise around this time aswell going to the gym i lost about the weight i gained during a 2year period and started to feel a bit betterbut after this ocdperiod i started noticing i started to become extremely tired and fatiguedi worked at a hospital during this time so there were early mornings for worki was at the shape of my life during this time but my sleep and my energy levels were extremely low that i couldnt sit in a chair for work because that would make me fall asleep on the spot i started to noticing the bags under my eyes became more and more darker and more visiblei also started to notice that my brain didnt function as well as it used to this i noticed by the way my logical thinking was disappearing more and more i just couldnt think clearly i couldnt find solutions to simple problem like i used to be able to my ability to think outside the box was gone

fast forward a few years to the pandemic during the pandemic my stress went up to a level i didnt know existed i became a super hypochondriac for about 2 years my stress was through the roof and i was so afraid of becoming sick this stress was so intense everyday i cant describe it really but it really took over my life my body started to respond less and less to my workouts because of the stress i guess i couldnt push my body the same way i could before because as soon as i did i just got sick shortly after i gained alot of weight around my waist my brain started to shutdown even more than before it was like there was no room for nothing else in my brain than stress i didnt react when a close relative of mine died because i was so up in my own brain and stress that i just wasnt able to feel anything my sleep got worse my sleep has been crap since ocdperiod ive literally not felt rested in the morning since before the ocdperiod but even less now after the pandemicand my body and brain just isnt the same since after all these years of stress  depression

these days i feel like im living in a vacuum im just existingi cant understand what im looking at what i read sometimes i have a hard time understanding and solving problems im just walking around in life and not being able to comprehend whats going on on a deeper level  i feel like my brain works at 10 of what its capable of because i know i was quite smart before atleast compared to my current state  my memory and vision has become like a 90 year old and my tolerance to stressful situations has become awful  if something happens for example when a person is going a little bit too close to the subway tracks my stress just spikes through the roof and im starting to shake and cant speak for about 5 minutes because im shaking and cant breath and get words out sorry for weird exampleanother example is when im going to talk infront of people the same happens i just start to shake i become very cold and i have problems even saying a single word because i barely cant breathits like ive become supersensitive to stressful situationsi functioned bad before the pandemic but now after the pandemic its just another leveli just seem to not function the way i used to before

because of all this my friends call me old man because its like im a 28 yo in a 90 yo bodyi always wear cap especially in the morning to to hide my dark circles i never look myself in the mirror with the lights on the first hour or so in the morning because it looks like ive been partying and drinking for 2 weeks straight and for this when i see myself in the mirror with those dark circles i shiver in my body because of the disgust of how i look

the gym and the goal to be a bodybuilder seems to be very far away but that is one of the things that actually keeps me going without that my life is extremely gray and boringthe way i write is all over the place but im trying my best in the shortest way possible to describe my issuesive done evaluation for sleep apnea like 3 times and theyre saying that i sometimes do stop breathing during my sleep upwards of 1 min sometimes but not to get the diagnose of sleep apneai took blood tests before to check my hormones and they  vitamins were also in decent range but that was a couple of years so that might be something to do aswellive tried alot of supplements to boost my energy etc but i feel like i need so much more than just a couple of supplements my waist is also putting on size very easy which is also common when there is high stress

"being taken off of medication  i’ve recently been taking clonazepam and it’s had a near instantaneous effect  however my psychiatrist does mention it will be for acute use only and within 24 they will be tapering it off until i’m not on it at all 

in tandem with this i’m taking lisdexafetmine for disordered eating but ive heard some people can grow restant to it effects  

i’d very much like to remain on both of them indefinitely i’m terrified to be taken off of either  i’ve felt more like myself while being on them   

i suppose i’m wondering how they’ll do this and will they  for lack of a better word ‘leave me high and dry’ since for at the minute it feels as though i can’t function without them

"trigger warning discussion of c in the media how to handle medical media coverage around c rates in my age group hello 

i am a 30f longtime haocd sufferer who has been managing my mental health well with medication and therapy for some years with occasional flairups and fixations  i was hoping to talk to the group on how you manage to cope and not overcatastrophize when coming across health related media  

i am sure it is due to my past of obsessive googling but i am often presented with stories in my various newsfeeds about studies regarding increasing rates of a certain disease hinted at in the title that i fear more than anything else  it is so difficult to ignore what these studies seem to suggest about the growing risks for my age group and this has resulted in lots of hypervigilance on my part and a feeling of futility or certain doom lol  i have gotten checked out multiple times with all clears all around but of course the nagging what ifs are in full swing 

i just wanted to see how other people are thinking about this or if others have noticed this media focus lately do you chalk it up to lots of health media outlets running wild with negative information that will get lots of hits  or is the goal to simply raise awareness in younger folks  either way its torturous  i know that most health media is geared towards people who dont worry like some of us do but damn its leaves me feeling like a ticking time bomb i know there is some truth behind these studies but how to not let it consume me  not sure if this will be deleted but just seeking some support on how to navigate this stuff  thanks for your time ",1

"what if we reframed our mental health issues so what do we mean by ’reframe’   
  
in its simplest form reframing is about looking at a topic from a different – more resourceful  perspective we can reframe ‘i’m too old to do that’ to ‘i have all this experience to make a success of that’ we can reframe ‘i can’t do that’ to ‘once i have developed this capability i’ll be doing that easily’  
  
consider this reframe of many definitely not all of our mental health issues reframe ‘mental health issues are rooted in biochemical abnormalities’ to ‘mental health issues are a predictable response to living in contradiction of our true nature’     
  
there is nothing new or controversial in saying that many aspects of our modern lives are out of kilter with our natural evolutionary legacy in his 1969 publication ‘the human zoo’ desmond morris explored how we respond to modern life’s pressures such as they were in the 60’s now they are turbocharged from a zoologist’s perspective especially he noted that under normal conditions in their natural habitats wild animals do not mutilate themselves attack their offspring develop stomach ulcers suffer from obesity or commit murder   
  
among human citydwellers sadly all these things occur does this then reveal a basic difference between the human species and other animals at first glance maybe but this is deceptive other animals do behave in these ways under certain circumstances namely when they are confined in the unnatural conditions of captivity the zoo animal in a cage exhibits the abnormalities that we know so well from our human companions clearly – he concluded  the city is not a concrete jungle it is a human zoo  
  
the comparison we must make is not between the citydweller and the wildanimal but between the citydweller and the captive animal modern humans are no longer living in conditions natural for our species in our cities and lifestyles we have set ourselves up in huge unpredictable menageries where we are in constant danger of cracking under the strain  
  
jumping forward 40 years the global burden of disease’ study carried out by the seattle  based institute for health metrics and evaluation as published in the lancet 2012 identified the underlying issues behind world’s top health problems from a different perspective the massage is the same we pay a price for ignoring our evolutionary legacy the underlying causes of the world’s top health problems are not unfortunate biochemical abnormalities they are a function of how we choose to live our lives that we have the agency to make different choices is a cause for optimism i have posted a more detailed piece on this study on my own little corner of the redditsphere  
  
much of what passes for normal in our society is neither healthy nor natural so much of our normality – set against our evolved needs – takes us offbalance harming us on the physiological psychological and spiritual levels  
   
consider what has been normalised about health and illness through this reframe when we see the current normal as not the way things are meant to be we see the possibility of realigning with our evolutionary legacy  
  
so if we reframe much maladies not as a cruel twist of biochemical fate but rather a consequence of abnormal unnatural circumstances it could have profound implications for how we manage our personal wellbeing ailments would no longer be regarded as expressions of individual pathology but as indications of where individually and societally we have gone wrong looking through this reframed lens offers the potential for improving our own wellbeing and our societys’ more generally  
  
ever more convincingly the science is showing that health and illness are not random states in a particular body or body part maladies often express an entire life lived they make sense not in isolation but as a function of circumstances relationships genetics epigenetics experiences and choices  
  
so assuming the above reframe has a degree of credibility this is what working with a nonmedicalised helper looks like  
  
•	reframe ‘what is wrong with you’ to ‘what happened to you’  
•	reframe ‘what are your symptoms’ to ‘how have you adapted to what happened to you’  
•	reframe ‘helping focused on individual symptoms and behaviours’ to ‘helping focused on the whole person recognising they are living within systems that impact them’  
•	reframe ‘clients are sick ill or bad’ to ‘people are generally doing the best they can given their circumstances’  
•	reframe ‘medics are the experts so they take control’ to ‘helpers collaborate to support the client in developing their agency’  
•	reframe ‘outcomes are set by the medic’ to ‘outcomes are agreed between the client and the helper’  
•	reframe ‘help is focused on managing symptoms to ‘help is focused on implementing solutions for sustainable wellbeing’  
  
if you are experiencing some form of malady presently consider these reframes how would they help you achieve and sustain your longterm wellbeing how would they help you better than the current provision

"im sure people think im very dumb so besides all the horrible physical symptoms i have due to anxiety the mental symptom that i struggle with the most is brain freeze  i simply cant think

couldnt understand a conversation over the years i was able to recover from it overall i finished my degree and started working in very simple jobs due to my delay until i felt more like myself again however it seems like not all of the symptoms were uniquely from the burnout when i’m dealing with something new or stressful or even when i’m with friends but very tired i stop thinking and most of times i’m not alone and i’m sure it gives people the impression that i’m just slow i was not like this before

"i hate my job and can’t seem to leave hello i am new to this community and looking for some advice currently i am the main breadwinner for my husband and i some months i make more than twice what he does because of overtime requirements since we don’t have kids and i make a reasonable amount we have a pretty decent quality of life we are not rich but we can comfortably make emergency purchases without worrying about being out of money lately i have been having more and more anxiety surrounding my job and it is causing my performance to suffer which makes it worse

 i have been trying to leave this job i have applied to multiple other positions in my industry and will pay about the same and despite having a competitive resume i have not been able to get another job partly because i do not have a college degree and because i would prefer to wfh because of our dog and those are getting harder to come by i had another issue come up at work and even though it is fixable i feel terrible that i keep making mistakes and keep getting more work assigned to me i feel like my boss is getting more and more frustrated with me and of course wondering if i’m going to get fired soon for making mistakes i am considering taking a leave for a month or so to get my anxiety under control and relax for a bit while i apply elsewhere but i know the days leading up to returning i will be incredibly anxious whether i have something else lined up or not i want to quit really badly but we wouldn’t be able to pay our bills on my husband’s pay we have quite a bit put away but it’s from an insurance claim we have yet to use for its intended purpose i would hate to drain our savings before i find something else 

my husband has been at his current job for just over a year and took a significant pay cut after leaving a job that was taking over his life and schedule to the point that he would only be home long enough to have dinner and sleep we made the decision together and this job was his way of getting experience in the industry he wants to work in he is very happy having a super lax job and a standard schedule his plan was to start looking for a better job once he hit a year of experience so i would be able to take some time off if i needed it while i look for a job i actually enjoy and would feel more comfortable with he did apply to a couple but hasn’t been too invested in it i don’t want to make him leave a job he enjoys and make him possibly get back into a position where he is overworked for more money we are also wanting to start a family very soon 

i guess i am trying to decide what to do should i stick it out while i apply so we don’t have financial issues should i take a month off to collect myself knowing it will eat a bit of our savings and i will be anxious when i go back should i quit and do a short term job like door dashing push my husband to find a better job and risk not finding something else that fits what i am looking for ",1
"exams not sure where to start 
i have 3 very important exams in 2 months ive been preparing since december and im currently at the stage of just practicing old exams and exercises however im very worried whether im doing this the right way or not 

this is the second time im attempting these exams because last year i barely even studied and barely passed i now am a completely different person with completely different goals and im very dedicated and focused to get good results 

the problem is that i dont know how to balance work and rest so i end up working too much and bottling up my emotions and stress im aware of this but it doesnt seem like too much of a bad thing because at least im being productive and all i care about now is getting the desired results 

anyhow today is one of those bad days i woke up early to study like always and since yesterday wasnt the most productive day ever because i had to go out for a few hours i decided to go hard this morning my body didnt agree i guess so after half an hour of studying my hands started shaking my breath was erratic i started sobbing and i couldnt focus 
obviously i took this as a sign of a needed break but its honestly kind of ridiculous why do i get these overwhelming stressful feelings even after a day of relaxation and a very short lived studying session i have everything planned im doing everything like im supposed to do but i cant help but sometimes get these waves of stress that wash over me 

im starting to feel like im not smart enough to pass these stupid exams and since my future depends on these results i dont know what else to do but to study very hard but sometimes i just cant and it feels like im wasting precious time 
of course i take a few hours to rest and reset after a long day so i dont know what im doing wrong this is just so important to me i cant not stress about it 
this morning is already wasted and i feel like a failure
 this week was mostly slow as well i really need to pick up the pace but this overwhelming stress of the approaching exams isnt helping

"dealing with college stress makes me suicidal i have little reason to be depressed but i am anyway i have a lot of friends who i hang out and have fun with regularly i have family members i deeply love and care about i have interests and hobbies but when i’m alone i want to end it

i think a lot of it stems from the fact that i’m extremely stressed and anxious every day and i feel like an imposter i feel like my life has no direction or purpose anymore none of my interests and hobbies translate to a stable career so when i chose my college major i just chose english since it’s my favorite subject but i have no plan after college i don’t want to be a teacher and idk what else i can do i don’t have a good financial situation to fall back on so idk how i’ll ever repay all my loans

the worry i feel about my future is compounded by the stress and anxiety of my performance in school i used to be smart and always at the top of my class but the longer im in college the worse i become it’s to the point where i’m barely going to graduate next semester even though i’m already a senior i could never tell my friends about this they’re all extremely smart and productive but thinking about the event in which i fail to graduate on time and have to watch all my friends walk across the stage without me just makes me want to kill myself before spring to avoid going through that

i don’t always want to die but i find suicide to be really tempting on most days i feel like an imposter in every aspect of my life i genuinely don’t deserve success and everything would be so much easier if i just cut my life short now instead of trying to navigate life after college",1

"gad journey hey friends i have been a long term mental health sufferer for over 20 years early in my life this was quite strong on the depression side but as my 20’s and 30’s approached i really developed a much stronger tendency towards anxiety and was diagnosed with gad and associated depression i swore i was gonna stay off the internet  but i am really keen to hear some of your stories and also share mine to see how you have had most success

i started my ssri journey very late in life when i just felt i needed something to help i just couldn’t cope on my own anymore and after substance abuse in my 20’s and rough thoughts of not wanting to live i just thought enough is enough 

i saw a gp who prescribed me zoloft after 2 weeks i had my first ever panic attack but i won’t blame the medicine because i had no idea of the side effects and i got high as a kite that day and drank alot 

i decided to see a psychologist and to cut a long story short she did absolutely nothing for me i just don’t think she was qualified to do any sort of cbt her methods were useless 

i think took the time to find a gp who specialises in mental health and he has been a godsend 5 years ago he prescribed me lexapro 10mg and it was fantastic i just had a different pep in my step and most days were filled with happiness i was finally in a great place i met my now wife and life was great  after a year on it i decided to stop because i was feeling really good i tapered off pretty quickly and yeah we know how that goes i relapsed pretty strong and fell into a dark hole just after a few months life had gone to shit again so i went back on the lexapro and slowly life was getting a little easier it didn’t help that covid was here but that was life in this stint i started to see a psychologist and she was good had some good insight and after a year again on the meds i was like fuck yeah im ready to get off my doc did not recommend it but i did it anyways a much slower taper which was much more gentle 

i did pretty well off it i was able to cope and life was decent but about 10 months without medicine my wife miscarried our first baby and i just started to spiral again i tried to fight getting back on but a few trips to the er and a few many nights having to rely on valium i just knew it wasn’t going to be the right path i did feel really let down cos this psychologist was adament i would be ok without the meds and would live happily ever after although her method for me coping would be doing intense cardio 3 times a week which i absolutely hate as i am a weight lifter  but i tried as hard as i could would walk my dog every day try running etc but i just couldn’t shake the crippling anxiety and thoughts of not wanting to exist my now wife was seeing me deteriorate in front of her eyes and it was affecting our relationship big time

so here comes stint 3 of lexapro which im currently in has been about 2 years this time it was a little harder to get it working for me but i think that was self inflicted by getting off too early on both occassions and really convincing myself that ssri are so bad for u and going down the rabbit hole so i would always be anxious popping the tablets so my doc eventually gave me olanzapine to take for 2 weeks while i weaned back on just to help speed things up which it did

ok i am rambling on so lemme get to the punch line so i thought change is great so we moved to a new home in a new area and i love it been almost 2 yrs on this stint of lexapro i did have to upp to 20 and 15 when my wife was pregnant but i think that was situational anxiety because we lost a baby before and i was scared of being a parent suffering with anxiety and not being able to give a good life to my children so was back on 10 and life was good had our son and yeah i had my moments like we all do but my baseline anxiety was much healthier for about just over a year i have been seeing a new male psycologist and he has been fkn amazing he deffo is my guy that i need on this journey he is the only person who has made me break down crying getting to the roots of my anxiety his stance on meds is that they are a “crutch” and ultimately its all about learning how to trust yourself and love yourself and know that no matter what you got this and i 100000 believe that

soo… i decided once again i dont need medicine but this time i was taking a massively slow titration dropping 25mg and staying at that dose for 6 weeks then dropping again i did this with the help of my gp and psychologist i went from 15 down to now 5 going from 1510 wasn’t really an issue had my moments but nothing i couldn’t handle i got to 10 and thought i would stay here a bit my gp thinks 1015 is the perfect dose range for me but i kept working with my psychologist and he just made me feel so powerful that i can get off the meds so i decided i wanted to get to 5mg and see if i can handle life going down to 75 was deffo rockier to be honest i never really felt i stabilized and i stayed on that dose for about 7 weeks it wasnt unbearable but it also wasnt as easy going from 1510 but i really worked so fkn hard with my psycologist to try and keep smashing my triggers change the way i think etc so here comes 5mg i felt ok surprisingly going from 755 i actually had 0 physical symptoms i thought fuck ok i got this my psycologist told me well ur basically off the meds now cos ur not taking a therapeutic dose so i was like wow ok i maybe cured it 

anyways 25 weeks on 5mg and man slowly i started to feel my depression coming back not anxiety strangely just depression not motivated always tired even if i slept well irritated didn’t want to do much etc but i put this down to “discountinuation syndrome” but now it’s been about 2 weeks feeling i am slowly sinking again i also have extreme gastrointestinal issues going on and i don’t know if it’s food poisoning or anxiety related waking up with anxiety not able to chill have had some hard thoughts finding it difficult to spend time with the family i just don’t feel myself in my heart of hearts i think it is that i dont have enough lexapro in my system but i have read people saying they take 5mg and it works great but i am also 96kg so not sure 

my biggest dilema and why i am posting i guess is psycologists i feel like some are great but they have all given me what i sometimes feel like is false hope this last one i really trusted in and believed him about absolutely being able to smash anxiety and depression without any medicine my gp though is on the other side who doesn’t believe gad is curable for many without medicine it’s like he and the psycologist are against each other a little gp says they are great but also push their own agenda psychologist also says gp’s don’t understand the brain like we do etc 

i try to find information on whether gad is curable purely on therapy alone but not much viable information on the internet i am just concerned that i have had this wave of sadness come over again and it does make me wonder should i just shut up and take 10mg lex for the rest of my life because i have tried so damn hard and exhausted many other methods and for all the hippies yes i did experiment with cbd thc and micro dosing shrooms it didn’t work for me 

a part of me is thinking if i should persevere and just see if maybe my mood gets better and it is just a tummy bug or discontinuation syndrome but the other part of me is like wait you have been here before and unfortunately we know how it might go i also have a 9 month old baby and family i want to be the best version of myself for every single day it is really tough to decipher what is relapse vs withdrawal but titrating didn’t feel like this especially now that i am below a therapeutic dose

so i guess after i rambled on lol my questions are

1 gad sufferers did any of u find therapy alone cured you

2 are psychologists limited and sell sometimes a bit of a false dream

3 are gp’s not educated well enough and should we be prioritising a psychologists advice over them

my psycologist basically wants me to keep fighting through this to come out on the other side beating it

my gp sees it more as i don’t want u to suffer and struggle in life and ur medicine is very safe

i value and trust them both and am seeing them again over the next few days at the moment in my heart and mind i want to grab my lex and just start taking 10mg again but in a strange way i will feel like i failed again and all that work with my psycologist would have been for nothing but suffering is also horrible

thanks you for hearing me out stay blessed ❤️",1

"clinical anxiety depression hey everyone

i have been coping with anxiety and depression for over 5 years from now and took medical treatment with escitalopram for 6 months and propronalol for 2 months back in 2022   
now a days again im having constant episodes of low energy and easily get anxious and depressed and chronic stress causing my resting hr 80100 though it used to be 6075   
through all these years ive undergone various blood tests and most of the times my vitamin b12 was like  
vit b12  1895 pgml in 2022  
vit b12  2212 pgml in 2023  
vit b12  2846 pgml in 2024  and im in my twenties age group

similarly my vitamin d3 used to be 1915 ngml  
i also have regular stomach acidity issues throughout the year got tested for anti ttg iga and igg which both came negative   
my thyroid levels ft4 and tsh are within normal range and cbc also in normal  
things i am going through are spasms in different part of body muscle twitches high anxiety heart palpitations and feeling my heartbeat  a weird symptom which further gives anxiety

did ecg and echo several times and it came normal except for sinus tachycardia or sinus arrythmia as i get nervous in hospitals and with fear the heart rate goes above 100 in hospitals

the thing is i want to work on my low levels of vit b12 finding proper cause rather just taking meds which most docs do here no doc cares to look for the real cause and i hardly request them to take my b12 tests and am not a vegan so such low levels of b12 should not happen  
sorry for my bad english please help me find a way

about 2 weeks ago one of my lymph nodes swelled up to the size of a golf ball and then i started developing coldlike symptoms dealt with that for about a week and once it went away i began a spell of vomiting where i threw up at least 14 times in one night before i stopped counting fast forward another week to today and i still dont have an appetite now starting today my throat is extremely sore hurts to swallow and hurts a whole lot more to yawn every time i mention these symptoms to family members and friends the first thing they ask is are you stressed but i always answer i dont think so

"ocd and health anxiety shift hi everyone

i’ve struggled with ocd and health anxiety since i was a kid before 2018 my ocd and health anxiety were primarily focused on my own health and i frequently visited doctors to check my heart blood and overall health from 2019 to 2021 i was constantly worried i was going to die and i had strong feeling i was gonna die

however things changed in december 2022 when my mom got severe covid seeing her so sick triggered a panic attack and since then i’ve been extremely anxious about her health whenever she gets a flu or cold i become overly alert constantly checking and overthinking that something more serious is wrong

now i try to avoid places activities and even songs that remind me of before she got covid and when she had it fearing that these might somehow cause her to get sick again i also obsessively clean and disinfect my apartment before she visits which i’ve never done before

my anxiety and ocd seem to have shifted from worrying about my own health to obsessing over my mom’s health i think the trauma from her severe illness has worsened my symptoms

has anyone else experienced something similar how did you manage it any advice or support would be greatly appreciated

its long story short

thanks",1

"some reflections 1 it can seem justified to the mind to worry about a single particular thing but its hard to justify being in a state of mind where you worry about a lot of things so every single worry is itself not necessarily problematic but if you add them all together you have a problem since no single particular worry is necessarily that bad its hard to justify that you should stop worrying about that thing and that keeps the whole thing rolling

"can anyone provide any ideas for alternative therapy or psych services hey this might not apply to anyone outside australia but i would guess were all in the same boat

ive had the classic symptoms of anxiety disorder on and off for years now  constant worry muscle clenching irritable sweating trembling dizziness then comes the fatigue then the trouble sleeping then the bad mood and around and around it goes then i spend the weekend in bed to regain enough energy to face another week i hope this doesnt sound familiar to readers but i think it just might

so i figured it was time to get some help before it ruins my life any more so i ring around a few psych services and after saying pardon a few times it started to sink in  ill never be able to afford professional help

400500 initial consultation then 300 per 50 minute session after that for probably 20 weeks all going well after worrying about that for a couple of hours i now have no fingernails left

if you get the right gp doctor to refer you we can get 10 sessions at half price through the government if you can find a psych who does that sort of work a bit like legal aid lucky if you can get it and often the quality isnt what youd hoped for not being nasty but trawling fb groups forums etc it can be you get what you paid for

there are a few help line service available but they seem geared to helpingstopping the poor bastards who are about to self harm and id feel so guilty if i thought id taken a line that could have saved someones life

even  if i could get a referral im not sure 150 a week is doable now the landlord just put the rent up another 100 a week and 300 certainly is not

the best advice ive been given so far is to either go to a local doctor and hope they prescribe a workable medication or take up smoking grass these both have their own downsides and horror stories and you can spend  a lot of your life in a haze with either of them

ive checked out ai and its not ready yet to provide therapeutic help yet or even anything useful outside of some vacant looking avatar who tells you they love you and how clever you are

can anyone provide any useful leads or ideas please  thanks sofia

now i’ve been promoted and i am horrendously anxious again i’m in a role now with less time to finish the work i do have while i’m getting new work that i’ve barley been trained to do so i’m having to guess my way through it i’ve started drinking especially the night before work just to cope last night i was so worried about all my work that i couldn’t fall asleep so i called in sick as i don’t think i could work a 12 hours shift on no sleep due to my past sick leave i got a doctors note to be safe the doctor actually ended up putting today and tomorrow’s dates off now i’m in bed panicking about tomorrow and i’m wondering if i should at least use the extra sick day the doctor gave me and call in sick tomorrow i work really hard when i’m at work but i’m worried that they’ll get shitting if i call in sick 

i’ve tried talking with a manager who can only help so much as everyone else is in a similar boat and i just tried to reach out to one of those online chat things with a counsellor all she did was sent me a link to some breathing exercises ignored half of what i said and then disconnected 

i’m not sure what to do",1

"did you ever struggle to decide if your issues were a physical health problem or just chronic stress for me my life was going along as normal until randomly i started feeling really bad during exercise

i used to be able to hike 1015 miles easy now any amount of exercise triggers physical symptoms and a bad stress response

i seriously have to keep physical activity down to about 4045 minutes of just walking otherwise my mood is ruined for like a week i get stomach pains tinnitus sometimes weird blurry vision disturbed sleep pains around my body etc

sometimes when im walking i get lightheaded and feeling like im not quite balanced

i dont know why it came on all of a sudden there was no trauma and to be honest i didnt even feel particularly stress before all of this happened

i dont know if this is a physical health issue but its been 78 months now and docs have done test after test and are still not sure what it is

i did an antibody test which suggests i had covid at some point but never remember having it

tldr does this sound like chronic stress to you did it stop you from being able to properly exercise

i 26 f have been feeling unsettled in my new marriage to my partner 26 m we recently got married but have been together for over 6 years i often find myself stuck i thought on if i should stay or go and it’s making me feel terrible and guilty my partner is my best friend my whole world really he’s wonderful and supports me in every way we do have our differences like he prefers silence and i’m an anxious talker or he’s pretty religious while i’m not but we’ve seen through to all of our differences discussed it at great lengths and found solutions to them all yet sometimes i find myself over analyzing the relationship…like if he’s truly the one or even ever small thing he does like constantly checking in with myself to ensure i still love him… which i always find i do but it’s extremely exhausting and sometimes i wonder if i’d be happy out of the relationship but then i think everything that i stand to lose and how i may also be extremely ly miserable can you all relate to this feeling

"will i live like this forever hello everybody well i would like some help and maybe even advice ive had agoraphobia for about 3 years mine happens because im afraid of getting sick alone somewhere in that time ive had a lot of ups and downs recently i was at my best until last week i had a severe anxiety attack

  
after that i started having symptoms again that i didnt feel lack of energy feeling dizzy this feeling of dizziness is similar to getting up from your bed and feeling like youre going to pass out excessive heat and sensitivity to loud sounds i dont know if its knowledge or if this recent anxiety attack brought it back i dont do psychological support due to lack of money and when i think about doing a college internship even to pay for therapy im afraid i wont be able to stay there due to anxiety or even not being able to since obviously i wont be able to go accompanied by someone every day

this generally discourages me a lot it seems like i was never able to progress and always stay in this eternal cycle i really dont know what to do and i didnt want to have this i just wanted to be able to go to the corner of my house like anyone else instead of being without air and feelings of faintness and imbalance ",1

my last year and a half have been the most stressful in my almost 50yrs  apologies its lengthy they say the class clown or the funny person is usually fighting depression this has been me my entire life always striving to take care of and make others happy and to laugh this last year and a half has been te worst in my almost 50yrs on this planet first in july of 22 i had to resign from my job of 10 yrs due to political differences in my local government job after a change in director  keep in mind i was a 911 operator for 10yrs which is stressful all the time i came home told my boyfriend that i left my job and he took off after i had his back for months while he found a new job supporting him financially for those months a month and a half after leaving ky job my 28 yr old son lost his battle with addiction accidentally overdosing because he got high and took his sleeping medicationon top of it due to leaving my job i no longer had death insurance on him and had to pay for everything alone  his father did not give me a dime nor did he help with planning or participate or lift a finger in anyway  while awaiting his autopsy and return of his remains my father got diagnosed with lung cancer he never smoked but was a fire fighter in the 70s and 80s i was so afraid that i would lose him too that i avoided him i felt like the worst daughter in the world and my father is my person and i let him down i had never seen my father sick ever except when he had back surgery which caused him to retire on disability years earlier 2 days after my son passed my youngest son was in an accident he wasnt injured but it just added to the stress pile that was already a mile high at my sons memorial my mother made everything about her argued with the pastor and blamed me publicly for his death to multiple people not once did my mother ask me how i was feeling or if i was ok needless to say we no longer speak i cut her off after 2 straight months of belligerent text messages and berating phone calls during all this i had to find another job and participate in job interviews the new job took off to a really rocky start and didnt help my depression several coworkers gave me a hard time because they hated the agency i came from riding me for months after i logged a complaint with upper management it finally stopped a year and 3 months later and im just starting to feel somewhat normal by no mean am i over it just dealing and processing it a bit better talking about these things and sharing them with people who can offer support is helping me heal and necessary for my mental status,1

"overwhelm and anxiety hi everyone 

ive been working at a fortune 100 company for the last 5 years the majority of my time has been spent in an analytics role first as a data analyst and then 25 years as an analytics manager

currently i have 1 analyst reporting to me he spends the majority of his time doing ad hoc data analyses for various stakeholders as well as buildingmaintaining dashboards and a little bit of data management i have been in his role before so i make a concerted effort not to overload him like has been done to me in the past

currently i have 20 different items on my plate ranging from oneoff analyses weekly reports dashboard development full scale crossdepartmental projects me as pm and several projects where ive been tapped as a contributor these requests come from all over the place and i keep my boss updated in our weekly meetings and he helps me prioritize

but honestly im just so emotionally and mentally exhausted that ive been fantasizing about just resigning and saying fuck it all job or no job ive been applying with no luck im constantly getting my attention pulled in countless different directions and everyone comes to me with their cool ideas and unique problems i cant think straight and i definitely cant innovate worth a damn i feel completely ineffective and my selfesteem is in the trash can i barely go into the office anymore because my anxiety is so bad and i sometimes start crying at my desk and have to leave anyway hybrid workplace

when i bring up my stress and anxiety my bosses have listened which i appreciate but then they recommend things like getting my hormones checked or getting on medication ssris lorazepam etc one even gave me his copy of rewire your brain i feel like an utter failure especially when i know how busy everyone else is also i dont think im a horrible manager because i was highly successful in managing a 4person team and helped make millions of dollars for the company but hiring is off the table atm and i dont even think a larger team would help with such a broad range of responsibilities plus a lack of clarity siloed departments and little to no crosssystem integration 

for what its worth i have been rewarded for my performance i started at this company making 35k and now i make 90k and i got some rsus for being a high performer i put in my 2weeks last year for another analyst job at the same pay but my boss met me for a beer and talked me out of it i dont only care about money i want to do a good job i feel like a pos for even complaining because i make good money and my life is objectively pretty good

i cannot say something like 30 minutes per day because my energy varies per day some days i can do more than 30 minutes some days less but should i only listen to my feelings then no because i did that for 2 years and i didnt get significant shit done i need a system to force through my feelings and get even more done but ofcourse not at the cost of my long term energy level

i dont know how i dont know at which moments of the day i have to be productive or to rest and i dont know for how long and i dont know how to determine it for myself either

"need help with severe hypochondria  16m uk

so for the past 9 weeks i’ve been experiencing some really horrible dizzinessvertigo intense headaches and what feels like severe cognitive impairment i’ve been put on medications sertraline and propranolol and have been doing cbt and emotional behavioural therapy 

in terms of medical history i’m completely healthy concussion a few years back and a diagnosis of occcular migraine i’ve also had a long history of hypochondria and pretty severe stress 

around 5 weeks ago i made a pretty stupid decision i decided to google cjd an incredibly rare neurodegenerative disease symptoms of confusion dizziness loss of coordination i am now terrified of said disease and am convinced i have it sporadic cjd 

now the reason i’m so convinced is because of the severity of the psychological and physical symptoms i’ve been experiencing my anxietyparanoia has never been this high i cannot function i cannot do things i feel so trapped and confused as i said i have had horrible bouts of hypochondria but they have lasted 26 weeksthis has been months now it doesn’t help that common symptoms of this disease are anxietydepressionparanoia and it is so difficult to diagnose

i’ve had an mri come back fine and two blood tests the ‘confusion’ i feel is strange ask me the time i know it ask me to do something i can do it but i feel so horribly detached my family look like strangers my house feels strange and my surroundings feel new my problem solving maths orientation has also gotten significantly worse i am no stranger to dpdr but this feels like nothing i have ever experienced before the doctors seem to have no concern about any of the things i’m experiencing but i just can’t shake this thought

i would also like to say that i’ve been completely coherent throughout this experience but i feel as though i’m losing my mind completely

sorry for the long post but if anyone ishas experienced such an intense period of hypochondria and experienced the same symptoms i’d love to know almost convinced i have it at this point ",1

"unemployed for years and starting college again but i’m encountering a lot of problems  i’m almost 30 terrified of my life and i want to give up please help i’ve been unemployed for a long time because i’m terrified of working and interacting with strangers 

i never held a job for more than 4 months and it’s because i’m a weakling who couldn’t handle the trauma from my first job harrassmentbullying from supervisor manager and coworkers  then all the other jobs i got afterwards i just kept getting more and more scared each time until i ended up just being unemployed

this anxiety is also affecting me trying to restart for a proper career i entered a university in my hometown my advisor delayed me so i decided to move to the usa to study in a college for an accelerated nursing course my advisor now sucks too even though i’ve been communicating with her since last year she’s only been changing the stuff we agreed upon last minute and adding more prerequisite classes i have to take they also rejected transferring most of my college credits from both the previous university i attended as well as my first degree

i’m gonna be delayed again and i’ll graduate maybe in my late 30s at this rate it’s not even guaranteed i’ll enter their nursing program because i have to submit my resume and my work history is full of gaps

what if this leads to failure again what do i do i’m old already now and i’ll be even older by then

i also feel so insecure cus i’ll be attending this college and i’ll basically be an underclassman to my 18 year old cousin and his 17 yo gf  and i feel so insecure about my age and my other younger cousins have such an easy life too they’ve been rich af they’re whole lives the older one who is in his early 20s has easygoing classes and professors those two cousins also have jobs that are chill too they always complain of doing nothing and getting paid

are people just lucky enough to live easy lives i’m witnessing people living smoothsailing  easy progressions of careers and life experiences

mine has been full of painful and traumatizing experiences why am i so weak to not overcome anything i thought all the hardships would lead me to success and being stronger but i’ve only gotten weaker and dumber

i can’t even afford therapy idk what to do my life is over i’m so ashamed and so scared the depression is bad and my anxiety is through the roof",1
"my mum gets anxious about my anxiety and she’s coming over today i also posted this in the ocd subreddit because i’m just looking for some advice before she gets here 

my mum is coming over unexpectedly today she does need to she needs to pick up some pet supplies i’ve bought for her so i can’t postpone and i’m in the midst of a panickyvery anxious day where i’m basically more primed than ever to confess my intrusive thoughts to her 
i’m super anxious and i am lacking in tactics to manage the visit i really don’t want to tell her about my intrusive thoughts because she gets really anxious herself whenever i talk about my mental health and she doesn’t know about how bad my intrusive thoughts around harm can get she just gets really anxious when she hears about it in a general sense even without specifics 

i often won’t see her when i’m not doing well because i don’t want her to worry and also because she’s prone to then catastrophising on my behalf she’ll start texting me and introducing doubt about whether my medication is working whether it’s worth continuing to see my psychologist because ‘maybe they’re not helping’ etc 

i’d never want her to know i feel this way because i know she does all of this out of compassion and care but it’s just misdirected and i think she’d freak out if i accidentally confessed my intrusive thoughts  i don’t know how to be stable while she’s here ",1
"dizziness  dissociation im a 27 yo man in athletic shape

about 15 years ago i started getting a weird dizziness feeling idk exactly how to describe it i could be driving down a hill and i wouldnt know if im going up or down or im sitting at dinner and if i had to get up to the bathroom id feel like i might fall over or look drunk even when sober its as if my balance is off not a spinning or visual dizziness as time has gone on ive been getting these episodes more and more now multiple times a day for anywhere from 10 seconds to multiple minutes it can happen when im hanging out with my best friend just chilling or in a business meeting i cant find a pattern of anxietystress time of day hungry dehydrated anything

4 months ago i went to the doctor because its progressively gotten worse i can cope but its not fun and its not something i want to deal with forever

blood was good they suggested physical therapy i dont really understand the reasoning i saw a lady and she thought maybe my eyes dont communicate to each other properly she referred me to a balance specialist the specialist said my balance is great i went back to the physical therapist multiple times because shes trying to figure out what triggers it and how to fix it but shell say herself that were shooting at a dartboard blindfolded

i made another doctor appointment and kind of demanded an mri i got the results and everything is good

at this point i think ive had 10ish appointments regarding this issue theyve mentioned seeing cardiology neurology and ear nose throat today i made appointments with an eye doctor ear nose throat and a psychologist

ive never had a physical issue besides a few concussions throughout high school and college that didnt have lasting symptoms im frustrated each doctormedical professional says maybe go see this department none of them communicate with each other and its to me to go find who to talk to ive spent a good amount of money and a lot of time driving city to city to see different providers

could you take your best shot and try to diagnose this or can anyone relate i want to find a doctor that wont give up until they figure out at this point i feel like people think im making this shit up like dude ive been a very healthy person and i dont bitch just to bitch there has to be something that can explain this symptom but i dont know who to ask anymore and im tired of doing it with no continuity in care

i saw my doctor today to request a medication for my debilitating anxiety with some depressive symptoms i was expecting him to give lexapro or buspar but instead he prescribed me mirtazapine and said to follow up with him in 2 weeks  
is this a medication that might help with anxiety and depression i believe the dose he gave was 15mg to be taken at night i am asking because upon researching it seems to be a sedative which may help with my sleep and appetite issues but it seems unclear weather this would have any affect on my anxiety and depression during the day time like the next day after taking it  
can anyone else who is more familiar with this medication please enlighten me i believe i can get another appointment for thursday to ask for a different med or else i also have an old bottle of zoloft sitting in my cupboard that i never took but am considering starting tonight since i already have the follow up appointment in 2 weeks so i could just tell him i started the zoloft instead of the mirtazapine

i have two siblings  one is helping all they can but has a terminally ill spouse  the other has helped some but generally just makes excuses and puts it off on me or has their spouse text me to tell me to leave our parent in the facility and if something goes wrong they will call my parent has had several medical mistakes issues where they have nearly been killed during this time im an hour away and have to use my weekends to handle my parents affairs my school breaks have nearly all been handling their needs or doctors appointments for me

its beginning to frighten me im terrified its something horrendous  i have other twitches here and there i always have but this is pretty consistent
im on a beta blocker for bp that has helped the stress tremendously as a side effect 
but the twitches keep happening  even when i feel less stressed i say something about my parent or think about an upcoming iep and i start twitching

"feeling like rubbishphlegm is in my throat f15 basically for 12 days i been feeling like rubbish is in my throat and i usually only get that when im sick with a cold or a flu or when im laughing

and im an emetophobe and rubbish is one of the reasons why i threw up when i was younger  due to a cold  flu  or a chest infection and the rubbish on my chest and throat probably built up to much  i had when i was younger but i have no idea if swallowing it is safe or not because i dont know how to cough it out

and im not sick right now and it just came out of nowhere and i can feel it in my throat

and i also been dealing with a sensation that i might gag or throw up  i feel it in my chest or mouth i cant explain where it is 

is this just a common anxiety symptom can somebody give me some reassurance that its normal and is swallowing rubbish safe im not getting any other symptoms besides those 2",1

"social anxiety story mini story time of whats it like for someone with an overactive amygdala 

so i like to go do work in my public library over the summertime because its easier for me to focus and i liked the vibes sometimes during the summer it can get kind of busy and hard to find a table during certain times a day but theres always the option of reserving study rooms 

these study rooms you usually have to book a couple days in advance to actually secure one because again busy library 

the study rooms only let you book 2 hrs per day which is nice but for someone who likes to spend pretty much their whole day there id be nice if there wasnt a limit i found a way around this when i realized its 2 hours per day per card and i could use my sisters card to book a room back to back for four hours

i do so and secured a room 10am2pm i arrive a little before 10 and enjoy my first hour or so in the room some lady comes up to the window and kind of smiles towards either me or the room next door i cant tell the walls of the rooms are pretty much all glass front towards the library and back view outside
she ends up coming in and telling me she has the room at 11 i apologize and tell her i thought i had until 12 i end up packing and leaving

i cant find an open table and im already kind of spiraling internally i thought id booked it on my sisters until 12 i know for sure i have that room at 12 on my account what if shes still there and she doesnt understand how i can have that room again or questions me ect 
note i absolutely dont do confrontation if i can help it and have previously arrive at a study room ive booked seen someone else in there with no sign of packing up and just abandoned the room because i didnt have it within me to tell them it was mine for the hour 

so i find a random decent enough table on the third floor and text my sister kind of jokingly about how upset it made me shes a much fiestier person than i am and immediately started telling me she would go off on this lady for me this lady wasnt particularly unkind in a way i felt warranted my sisters rage so after she sent me the confirmation email for the booking i headed back downstairs rehearsing how i would politely tell the lady she has the wrong room 

i arrive downstairs and can see that she seems to be having a meeting or something like it in the room im definetly not going to try and interrupt so i consider going to the front desk for help seeing if theres anything else available i could transfer the booking to before i do i realize the room right next door 2a is open the room she took was 2b

i figure she got the numbers mixed up and i could just use her room until i got mine back at 12 of course though i couldnt be sure of this my mind started jumping around even more did she book just until 12 or until 1 what if someone else actually has this room not her and theyre just running late what if she sees me as she leaves the room and judges me what if someone sees me jump from one room to the next and judges me what if i get comfortable again only to keep getting moved around should i have just stayed at that random table ect

at this point i absolutely cant relax nor focus on anything else except literally anyone passing by the windows towards the library and thinking about how they just might be looking at me and im such an idiot for not arguing more with the lady the first time as well as replaying exactly how that conversation went and how it should have gone after about 20 minutes of sustained anxiety i pack up my things and go home i cancel my booking for 12 to 2 for good measure as well

i know it was irrational and my fight or flight chose flight hardcore for what could probably be considered immature reasons i dont hold any malice towards the random lady for what i assume was her honest mistake but i couldnt get over the fact that for no rational reason the disruption made me feel unsafe and i couldnt fully calm down until i got home laid on the floor and cried a little bit then wrote out this post to memorialize my panic

"urgent advice needed  hi everyone i’m writing this because i’m very overwhelmed and a little nervous for someone’s safety i have anxiety and ocd myself but am doing much better now my older brother is showing signs of ocd and very intense intrusive thoughts to give a quick run down of the situation

about 6 years ago my brother was in a barcasino with some of his friends and there was a group of girls that approached them at this time and one of them asked him for his snap chat he was in a relationship at this time and he felt very guilty about it afterwards and well he gave her this snap so her and her friends could possibly meet up with his group later in the trip she messaged him later that night asking what there group was doing and he replied they a were all out to dinner they did not talk for the remainder for his trip a few weeks later he was out with his friends at home and sent a snap of his face or the bar this was a snap that went out to everyone he was friends with at the time he then thinks the girl snapped him back complementing him and then he thinks he replied thank you 

now on to the pressing issue where he met this girl was a 21 setting and he is freaking out that she could have possibly seen him an explicit photo now he is convincing himself that she was possibly underage and that he could become a sex offender i have tried to rationalize with him that he would have remembered a conversation like this he feels like that just because he was drinking she could have possibly told him she was under 21 or that he missed it  i have tried to explain these are not situations we forget and that this it just the horrible reality of intrusive thoughts we just don’t know why this is occurring six years later and why it’s hitting him at such full force now if anyone has any advice at all or any words of encouragement it would be greatly appreciated",1

"do you ever feel like if people only knew the real you they’d all hate you and like… you can take meds but they’re only wallpapering over the kind of person you truly are

and it’s very much a bandaid over bullethole type situation

and with the body’s tendency to build tolerance for drugs over time it’s only a matter of time before what you’re taking stops working and everyone slowly distances themselves from you

and try as you might to change the underlying person left to your own devices your social instincts are terrible and you read hostility into every even neutrally coded interaction

and that everyone else will just turn their backs on you the second they deem you as not bringing enough value into their lives

and people say they want to be accommodating but the moment you inconvenience them in the slightest with your characteristic disproportionate worries about all the hypothetical things that can go wrong about the world they’ll be quick to disown and even denounce you

and all words of comfort are really skin deep and really more about selfassurance than actually meaningfully meeting you where you’re at in life

and though they’re too polite to say it your anxiety when acted upon really does make you a burden and a nuisance in their eyes hence why they all fade away so fast when it expresses itself

and you keep all these thoughts to yourself because you know it’s considered impolite to ask others to do ‘emotional labor’ or otherwise bombard them with too much to consider

and these thoughts are always working in the back of your mind causing you to question the truly lasting potential of any aspiringly long term relationship you have with people

and though they tell you that you’re not alone in your experience the more you open up with people about how you truly perceive the world the faster you drive them away

and though they said that speaking your truth would set you free and help to connect with with other like minded souls who are going through similar things the end result of your expressed ruminations is generally a feeling of further isolation and the confirmation that you are a stranger to this world and those in it

"a low weekventing my sadness just a warning in case anyone else has been dealing with suicidal ideation please just ignore my post cause i don’t want to trigger anyone

well where do i begin it’s been a pretty rough start to the new year at least from a personal level i have never really been a positive or happy person despite what my parents continue to reiterate to me i am pessimistic and for the most part i have gotten use to my outlook on life but even for me it is getting tiring how can i muster up the energy to go outside if all i feel is glaring and judging eyes looking at me how can i go outside and pursue a career when the first thought of putting myself out there is negative judgment 

i recently graduated from university and for me a person who experienced so much anxiety it was a miracle but now i don’t see a step forward what do i do next without the structure of classes i am lost and because of my fear of judgement i just can’t muster up the energy to apply for anything i am qualified for

i tell my parents and instead of helpful advice i just keep getting bombarded with negative words lecturing me on why i should have a job already why i should have a relationship or why i should be like all the other normal people they see around them doesn’t help that my neurodivergence was not detected until i was already an adult and that my neurotypical younger brother is finding life easy and i know that it is easy to say that as an outsider that my golden brother may not find life easy but i know he does

today was just another day of me being told what i should be doing how i should be doing things and that i am wasting my life leading me to feel alone and worthless it would be so easy to just cut my arm like i normally do but make it deeper wrap my throat and feel the pressure before darkness takes over 
but then i feel bitter about what my death would invertible cause my parents lying about who i was a person they never spent time getting to know playing mourning figures when they could never care about me whenwhile i am alive the less than a handful of friends who showed me love remembering the good times but also the bad many of which may never find out about my death because i have such a separation between family and those who i care about

the only thing keeping me from ending it all is that fear of being remembered incorrectly being thought of in ways that are fabrications from a parent’s vanity 

even now while writing this i am sitting next to a blade knowing full well that one day my self control will be gone and with it so will my life",1

"reposting for timesensitive advice burnout rant i am completely depleted i have no more time to recover and i just want to lay down and abandon myself entirely im at the end of my masters degree art related and i realize im not going to make it ive stopped replying to emails weeks ago stopped taking care of myself ive spent every waking hour for the past term past year even trying to work on projects and commissions but i havent been able to make a single one multiple projects which are needed for me to graduate are now a day from being presented and weeks overdue but the time between looking at my laptop and having a breakdown isnt even a factor anymore because its so insurmountable i can barely react  

despite asking for mental health support months in advance to avoid this scenario only to be met with blank stares or dismissal despite sacrificing the potential supports and friendships i couldve had so i could focus and try to turn things around repeating the phrase i just need to get through it religiously
its past the point of saving and i fear im not going to recover from this kind of let down

i hate that i have nothing to show for it that i was wrong about the person i thought i was and ive become a person i cant recognize the worst part is im not the only person ive let down because of it i wish people could know how sorry i am for letting it get this bad i wish people could know how hard i tried

not long ago i met an extremely nice and understanding person on a video game since we can both talk in voice on this game we had to face the fact that this day would come 
to explain the situation better you should know that i have a lot of stress problems that make me have anxiety attacks like most people here following past events in my life 
i see a sophrologist and i used to see a psychologist but i can see that i never have the time to do the breathing exercises that my sophrologist gives me 
because of my stress i cant stand the world cinema theater shopping malls etc 
and so it may seem strange but i can stress through a video game 
however in this situation im not supposed to be stressed because shes really an incredible person 
but i might have an idea of why im stressing out last december i made a friend on the same video game but after several weeks we had a fight and it all went to hell it might seem really childish that i got attached to this person who didnt deserve my trust so one day i heard her criticizing me to an unimaginable extent 
i was afraid of abandonment and especially because at that time i was under a lot of stress i had the feeling that everyone was coming down on me 

that day i had experienced my greatest fear 
except that with this person we used to talk a lot in vocals but after that event i didnt really like talking in vocals anymore 

so i feel like a loser and that im exaggerating my reactions for so little but i dont want to disappoint the person i met recently especially since hes so nice

i’m eating my lunch and then i hear a couple of them talking about how one of them brought supplies up to my floor the other one proceeds to start talking crap about lazy mf’ers and stuff based on context i was nearly certain they were talking about me i immediately go into a fight or flight response and couldn’t even finish my lunch i just sit there doing deep breathing and trying to calm down i eventually approach the woman who was talking crap and she gets all nice and swears that she wasn’t talking about me i’m not entirely sure i believe her
but in that moment of anxiety i was at the point where i was willing to get up and just walk out quit my job on the spot i don’t know why i’m like this and i hate it it’s happened before at other jobs and other people saying stuff to or about me it’s like i have this sudden anxiety spike and adrenaline dump over some stupid words from people i don’t even like ",1
scared to try xanax and zoloft  for the past month or so since i was prescribed i’ve been taking xanax nearly everyday because my anxiety is that bad i’ve been resistant to taking zoloft again for the fear and uncertainty of taking them both in one day and seeing what happens i’ve talked to my pcp and now a nurse psychiatrist even though i hear from them it’s safe i’m still so hesitant and afraid because i don’t know what could happen…any one willing to give me advice,1
buspirone and zoloft i 29f just had an appointment with my psychiatrist she increased my sertraline from 50 to 75mg and added buspirone 5mg 2x daily does any one have any experience with this drug combo i looked it up and apparently there is a risk of serotonin syndrome should i be worried,1
"i’m afraid of old videos of mine being found i have extreme anxiety what should i do 

4 years ago i made really cringe videos i remember them now and i froze out of embarrassment and anxiety i made jokes about inappropriate things like lgbtq related and some cringe dances with cringe jokes i was a teen back then

for the past years it seems like nobody is giving a shit about these videos until some random person that l have known in the town we talked back and forth sometimes this person found an old video of mine in his album accidentally and sent it to me and said is this you at this time i had a really extreme panic attack and the fear started to be something real

the account back then had some following and some engagement i’m pretty sure some people saved them the videos are not extremely cringy but somehow they are still cringy definitely not the cringiest 

back then these videos were normal and people viewed them as funny or a bit controversial but not extremely cringy 

i’m entering the work field right now and planning to marry soon but the idea of people finding out about these videos and changing their minds about me is keeping me at night

meme accounts that upload old cringy videos always give me a panic attack i always think they have my old videos checking them obsessively knowing it’s a small chance that they know about me 

to be fair no one seems to really care about them because they were not the cringiest thing to upload if i have a meme cringe account 

i have friends and i’m pretty respected around my circle i’m doing well in life generally 

but i’m afraid i will be canceled or lose respect or people not accept me because of these old cringy videos i’m a pretty different person now not like what i used to be 

this idea is really affecting my life now i think about leaving the country the starting a new life where these videos will not make any difference in that countrys society


is my fear real or i’m exaggerating things or it’s just an ocd thing

"physical anxiety which triggers mental anxiety  and a lot of the times is after eating  hello  

i’m new here
my anxiety started about 4 years ago  i’m 35 literally one day to another 
it use to happen when i partieddid drugs which i’ve subdued drugs
then it was simply drinking hangover  

… it’s now evolved into  full fledge monster which is easily triggered … with something as eating a burger or sushi or just staying with me for two weeks… 
my biggest symptoms is full on tachycardia then like … pain in the chest like shocks in the chest and left arm i always think imma die  … i’ve done the er quite a few times in the last years and saw a cardiologist about a year and a half ago  who connected me to an apparatus and did things like ekg etc came back completely healthy  

i’ve seen my doctor a couple times … and he diagnosed me with chronic anxiety wanted to give me anti depressants etc i have taken any  … also i have pretty bad gerd acid reflux etc all that good stuff  and they seem to go hand in hand 

ive been to a few doctors and only thing to come abnormal is my blood pressure  which sometimes is a little high … but i feel like my blood pressure shoots easily and most of them say not to worry i feel like my heart sometimes is so sensitive … my heart will start racing at time from getting up to go to the bathroom or if it starts getting busy at work i’m a bartender  i’ll catch myself clenching my al teeth  heart racing and scratching my chest etc 


i’m have made small changes here and there … but nothing that’s really impacted my symptoms  

can anyone relate  any suggestions 

anyways

"does anxiety does this thing to you so recently i just got a pregnancy scare and ever since everytime i go out i notice things that are related to pregnancy or hear it on a random shorts on youtube tiktok or whenever just anything that relates to it even tho she said she already got her period i still hear stuff like my brain picks it up even tho im not paying attention to it

so my question on this is that does anxiety always does this to your brain picks up stuff that scares you and focuses on it even tho you dont really mind it

"inconsolable i just dont know where to start in my writing so much has been going on in my life recently and i just havent been handling it well at all ive tried but i keep getting a sinking feeling in my stomach with each thought



  
i have been dealing with lonliness for all of my adult life i just turned 26 not too long ago and every time i look in the mirror i just think what a pathetic person i am to not have had a relationship yet at this point in my life i see so many people in relationships around me and i get so sad when i see them im happy that theyre happy together but i always reflect that onto myself and how i dont have that as pathetic as this sounds i cant even watch movies or tv shows that have intimate relationships in them because ill get too sad



  
my whole life ive been made out to believe that im always the problem when i was a kid none of my neighborhood friends invited me to play baseball in their yard i would always have to go over there myself and ask if i could play because they didnt think i was athletic or liked sports i was always the last on the wall in elementary school recess when it came to picking teams nobody wanted me i loved playing sports and i loved video games as a kid but my friends always saw me as the kid who wants to stay inside gaming all day long instead of playing with them 

  


i still feel this carries with me today nobody wants me even after repeatedly putting myself out there my own siblings dont want me i have a brother and a sister both younger my sister is two years younger and my brother is a bit younger than her who barely interact with me but they are always laughing and memeing and hanging out with each other without me just tonight my sister asked my brother if he wanted to go fishing but they didnt even bother to ask me my interactions with my siblings seem to be limited to one sentence a day and it makes me want to cry because i love them so much but i dont see any of that love returned to me



  
another thing that has been getting me very upset is how one of well i thought she was my friend has been treating me on social media specifically on snapchat she would reply to my stories with real snarky and mean comments if i seemed to be enjoying myself we used to work together just about a year ago and we had a great working relationship which ended up turning to a friendship ever since i left my job she has been treating me so poorly once again making me feel like i did something to her we have really drifted apart now that i left my job but i always made sure to ask how shes been doing from time to time i get very generic uninterested answers and she never once asked how ive been doing what am i doing wrong to deserve this



  
i have nobody



what the fuck is even the point of living anymore if im gone nobody would fucking know

how to convince myself that its just anxiety 4 months ago i called an ambulance thinking i was having a heart attack turns out it was a panic attack  every single day since i literally feel like im dying  ive got dizzyness drowsiness feel like i cant feel my hands super lightheaded and out of it etc ive done blood tests and been to the hospital seen doctors even went to the cardiologist  every test has came up clear and every doctor believes its an anxiety disorder  ive been on prozac started at 10mg then 20mg now 40mg and lorazapem 5mg for 23 months now  the main problem is that i just cannot convince myself that its just anxiety i mean i literally feel like im dying every single day its a nightmare  i was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and how you were able to convince yourself that theres nothing physically wrong with you and that it truly is just anxiety  thanks,1
"need to get this off my chest ive been struggeling with anxiety all my life i have a hard time dealing with situations that are new to me and seem scary the fact i have a bit of ocd doesnt help

my current anxiety is about rollercoasters not any but the one with loopings i know how incredibly silly this sounds but for me its a huge pain 

a couple of years ago i had huge anxiety about flying ended up avoiding a few booked flights  just couldnt go through 

i overcame this fear to such extent i could fly all over the world although the anxiety regarding flying is never really gone sometimes worse than other times i still go on them because i know living in regret is much harder than those few hours of flying

and somehow i cant make the same logic for inverted rollercoasters about 8 months ago i went through bit of a rough path in my life i remembered my fear of loopings and set this as a goal to get rid of the concerns it became a sort of obsession couldnt let it go

tomorrow i go to an entertainment park but the last few weeksmonths have been killing me i cant stop thinking about it i look a lot at pov videos but they dont make it better and im living in terrible fear of something that should be fun

almost everyone i know says that specific coaster is not bad and i also think if i would go on it i might like it and it would be really good for my self confidence even if i wouldnt like it

but at the same time i dont want to go on it i simply dont like the idea of loopings i want to overcome the fear but i also feel i cant handle it right now that sometimes it should be fine to not want to do something it feels ive been basically standing in line for that ride for the last month

yesterday i had a honest conversation about it with someone close to me that was relieving i feel the anxiety is consuming me at the moment i just want to have a nice day a nice future even but now i feel like that stupid anxiety over a 2 minute rollercoaster less even will make me feel living in regret and will make me not happy forever its idiotic but its how i feel

and yes i know a rollercoaster isnt an essential skill in life i know my ocd isnt making it easier but currently i just feel like a weakling because i decided im not ready for it together with the person we agreed to make it a nice day without the inverted coaster i would have to go on it by myself regardless because another person who would join me on them cant come at the same time i should also learn to live with fear regrets and failed goalsobsessions

im not saying i will never ride one with a looping but i feel this whole anxiety episode also shows i dont have good cooping mechanisms for both my anxiety and ocd

needed to get this off my chest feel stupid to even write this but also need to",1

"body aches from stress 

yesterday i was extremely tense for long periods of time due to anxiety because one of my coworkers was sick and doesnt really do a good job of keeping it from spreading i did my best to keep my distance and wore a mask and everything but sometimes he would get really close to me but id shuffle out of the way and at some point he was told to go on my register while i went on break luckily i didnt have to spend much time at the register because it was self checkout but there was no cleaning supplies at all so i would just use hand sanitizer whenever i had to touch it which thankfully wasnt a ton because it was a slow night

but the entire time i was extremely tense and panicky fists balled up hunched over etcetera and was panicky when i got home and this morning

but during my shift i had some body aches and of course i started panicking my mom said it was probably due to stress because of how tense i was ill admit i was a lot more tense than i usually am in situations like that i took some tylenol though not enough but i was still very panicked and the more i panicked the worse it got and i couldnt relax and the fact that i couldnt relax made me panic even more but eventually i calmed down and it went away later that was about six hours ago now theyve just lightly come back but ive felt fine other than that throughout the rest of the day no cold symptoms or anything in fact my nose has been clearer today than it was lately due to allergies 

this has gotta be stress right if so how can i get rid of these

i should also mention i havent eaten much today if that plays into it",1

i know it’s hard to stop googling so if you ever run into a wall of anxiety from a google diagnosis i always look up a very common daily thing that happens such as coughing you will see there’s so many reasons and i guarantee it will show signs of a bad illness it just reminds you google is very dramatic 


focus on something else play games go outside drink some water get your mind off of it i like playing strategic games personally like chess


talk to your friends when i have anxiety i always see if my friends want to play a game it takes my mind off of everything


chew gum try chewing the same gum every time the taste will remind you of the time you were concerned over something but here you are now


listen to music 


watch youtube or something 


exercise especially cardio

hope this helps❤️

"health anxiety unexplained weight loss has anyone ever heard of long term unexplained weight loss due to anxiety like over the course of months

so 2023 has been cursed 

the beginning of this year i had a health scare with a growth that thankfully turned out to be benign but before i was able to get it removed in june my terminally ill father who i take care of said his doctor wanted him on hospice and that he needed me and my mother to accompany him to his next appointment which was 1026

so for 4 months i was in a good amount of anxiety over him

ive been having some health problems and decided to put myself on a diet last month and then i noticed something from may of this year to october i lost 25lbs without trying 

thats concerning i went to my doctor today she was concerned she drew blood for a few tests i had a small breakdown in the office with her and asked her point blank how likely is this to be all stress induced weight loss and she replied very likely but we are going to check everything

now im laying in bed convinced i have 800 kinds of cancer crying my eyes out and begging god for help

update as of 61424

a month ago i had an issue that i went to the er for regarding my eyesight i was admitted to the hospital when they saw my hemoglobin was dangerously low 

i was admitted for testing and they found i had a large mass in my abdomen it was 13inches across and weighed 30lbs and essentially eating my kidney causing internal bleeding

after emergency surgery and a stay of nearly three weeks in the hospital the biopsy came back today i have been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer stage 4 liposarcoma that the doctor was able to fully remove 

because i waited for so long and trusted this gp i lost time and it got worse my surgeon was able to remove the entire mass and the kidney i will have to go to chemo and possible immunotherapy i will have to be monitored for the rest of my life because this kind of cancer grows back however long that life is now

listen to me do not wait if you dont like what your doctor says get a second opinion quick i was dismissed by that gp and she even went so far as to cancel orders she made for ct scans and certain fluid tests that would have caught this in november of 2023 when i first saw her she did this because one blood test she ran showed i was anemic but its not that bad and you need to lose more weight while i was literally wasting away 

i dont say this to ramp up anyones anxiety god knows the amount of panic attacks ive had in the past month have been insane but i say this as a warning cause ive learned so much in this time including my time talking with the surgeon and hospital psychologist

some doctors especially for women will dismiss concerns about your pain fatigue involuntary weight loss or even your hair falling out as your anxiety 

you can have your symptoms dismissed by a general practitioner but you know your body better than anyone else if what they say doesnt make sense to you do not hesitate to find another doctor for a second opinion hell go for a third opinion if you need to make them listen if they wont and ask questions 

you are all worth it ",1

for quite a while now ive been visiting my gp with a medley of odd complaints—persistent stomach and intestinal issues heart palpitations—maybe some of you have been through this too i was even diagnosed with an anxiety disorder once and subsequently treated for it

the past few years have been quite the rollercoaster marked by unceasing turmoil and stressors hitting me all at once its like a mix of positive and negative events colliding on the upside there was my wedding a new house and a major promotion at my job on the flip side the passing of loved ones concerns about a dear friends potential battle with cancer and even some taxrelated wrangling and no im not american among these one particularly significant development was learning about my parents enduring struggle with ptsd

after delving into this and undergoing thorough investigation it came to light that their ptsd has been silently active for over three decades as a 29yearold guy a lot of pieces fell into place regarding my upbringing i always sensed something was off and it turns out that growing up around this had quite the impact i was essentially swept into their trajectory because apparently children can mimic behaviors when raised by parents grappling with this condition this can lead to anxiety disorders cropping up later in life and a heightened sensitivity to stressors the coping mechanisms eventually mirror those of someone with ptsd even if the child isnt aware of the source of the trauma

now as the fog clears everything seems to be falling into its rightful place confirming the doubts i had about my upbringing so here i am wearing two labels—one for a burnout due to the whirlwind of events and another as a child who inadvertently mirrored ptsd

admitting to myself that something isnt quite right ive noticed an influx of both physical and mental struggles lately theres been this tingling sensation coursing through my body mostly in my hands and feet though its not constant im an emotional wreck—i hadnt shed a tear in years but now i find myself crying every day sometimes multiple times theres also this looming fear that perhaps this isnt purely psychological that there might be more at play overwhelming guilt is a constant companion too i want to be the partner my spouse deserves excel in the leadership role assigned at work and be there for my father in his time of need yet i cant help but feel inept and guilty when i stumble in these areas

have any of you faced similar challenges how have you navigated through them or how did you come to terms with your situation the doctors have advised me to take a sixweek break and rest at home but ironically this only seems to intensify my feelings of guilt

im reaching out because im eager to hear from those who might resonate with this and im open to any insights or wisdom you can offer thanks for being an amazing community

ps unfortunately it will take another 13 weeks before it is my turn to see a psychologist hence the questions the netherlands has a major problem when it comes to mental health as a result of which waiting times have become very long i also posted this post in one other stress related community on reddit to find help",1
do you also use ai to ease your health anxiety the past months ive been using chatgpt to tell it my symptoms and other things that concern me and its helped so much and has alleviated so much anxiety you can also tell it to not say a certain trigger word like if you dont want to see ms or als mentioned you can tell it to replace it with asterisks sorry for the rambling but does anyone else use ai for this reason,1

"anxiety is consuming me i cant take it anymore  i cant take it anymore

in 2022 i left my home state and my parents house to go to college i have always been someone with anxiety and introversion issues but they were manageable and could be resolved without medication

when i came here i was realizing my dream i wanted to live alone be independent i was doing well had some minor issues with loneliness but nothing serious

my parents made a considerable effort to get me here my mother doesn’t mention it but she probably went into debt to fulfill my dream

in 2024 everything started off very well i was starting my dream internship and i began a relationship with the woman of my dreams all my hopes were pointing towards a good year

this relationship was doing me a lot of good there was reciprocal love and moments that were new to me but in may everything fell apart she suddenly changed towards me and on the 24th we broke up since then ive been experiencing overwhelming generalized anxiety all the loneliness hit me

i can’t take it anymore i can’t sleep properly i sleep at one in the morning and wake up at four i have constant tachycardia i’m nervous and mentally fragile recently i went to the emergency room with panic attacks

i saw a psychologist started treatment with antidepressants and began taking alprazolam i have the support of my closest friends but nothing works i often call my mom to vent but she’s far away and i know it worries her

i shouldnt be like this its been 2 weeks since the breakup i no longer miss my exgirlfriend or want to see her but im in crisis i feel alone i want to quit college and go back to my family but how

how can i leave a course halfway through the internship of my dreams my parents investment

im trapped in my own thoughts tired i want to disappear i need help something to calm me down so i can at least go back to who i was",1
whats the point im trying to live right but i dont want to anymore this is a vent not a suicide so no im not going to off myself i dont think things are going to be okay anymore i dont think i have what it takes to make it i cant deal with this anymore for another who knows how fucking long the pills the overwhelming feeling of burn out the constant strain the sense of loneliness always having to be a damn pillar im tired im always fucking tired gods i wouldnt be surprised if this post gets taken down too for whatever stupid reason ,1

"random panic always feels the need to be doing something in moments of rest hello everyone looking for some advice as to have to cope with stress more efficiently
i am a young woman who is balancing between a fulltime job and a parttime job i’m constantly financially stressed and have some health issues that contribute to not feeling good half of the time and given the amount of work i must do to keep myself afloat i am not allowed to much time to rest

i am currently taking the time and looking for a more sustainable job so that i can live my life not just work through it with me making these changes and putting forth effort to have some time for myself i find that when i have moments of nothing to do i just feel overwhelmed

legitimately i could work on a hobby of mine or do something fun but it stresses me out to the point where i would just rather lay on the couch and scroll on my phone for some simple dopamine i want to be better but even doing anything that i enjoy stresses me out it’s like it’s too quiet and i keep myself busy with things that need to be done or clean so that i can avoid doing nothing

another thing that i’ve noticed is that when i’m in a peaceful environment we’re nothing could possibly go wrong my body goes into panic mode just recently i took the time and money to give myself a nice haircut normally i cut it myself

anyways when i was on the chair getting a really nice scalp massage and closing my eyes i just felt anxious i get these moments where i feel like i have to fight my body from lurching up from the chair and running out of the whole place it’s like i imagine it happening in my mind and i just going to full panic mode even though i know i’m safe

it hasn’t inhibited my life too much however the thoughts are unpleasant i am able to cope and call myself down however i just get confused as to why my body reacts the way that it does",1
was this a hypnic jerk super anxious now  i was in bed laying on my side watching a video on my phone when suddenly i remember feeling this sudden intense jerking down of my head and being startled i didn’t feel like i was falling and i really don’t even recall nodding off just relaxed and chilling watching a video and then 30 mins in or so bam ,1
do you know anyone who’s gone through a drastic personality change post anxiety before an anxietypanic episode my husband was a caring person still more logical than emotional but he learned emotions and now that he’s mostly recovered from an intense bout of anxiety his perspective on life is so twisted that it feels like he’s a stranger and that he’s shut me out of his life and nothing is getting through to him has anyone experienced anything similar or know anyone who has and have they reverted to the person they were before,1

"yawning and anxiety tw talk of anxiety attack




this might be over sharing but honestly just had the most relieving and weird moment like for the past i’d say 4 hours i’ve had a crippling feeling of anxiety in my chest and my heart rate has been through the roof i’ve been splashing cold water on my face icing my face and neck doing breathing excerises and listening to calm music but nothing was working and the anxiety just kept getting worse

i think it was just another prolonged anxiety attack but by the 4th hour i started to really struggle to breathe and my body then just started excessively yawning and i yawned about 10 times in a row and genuinely after that my heart rate almost instantly went back to normal and i felt like i could breathe again 

i know yawning is a common bodily reaction to stress and anxiety but it was crazy to just experience it first hand this evening 

wondered if yawning has ever helped anyone’s anxiety reduce aswell bc damn that was kinda crazy ",1

"what are panicanxiety attacks like for others are they the same for everyone or most people obviously theyre different but im asking because ive said i have had panic attacks sort of because my boyfriend said it was i think he said hes had them before how can i really know if it is one or not how do you all just know this stuff

im not even sure if what i call dizzy is dizzy i feel like im just faking stuff like im making it up

im still unsure how to identify them or if ive even had any or anything

edit

thank you all for your comments and im so sorry you have to deal with that

sorry if this doesnt help but for me what happens to me what i get what i think might be the panic attacks i get well to me sometimes i dont notice change except ig i just cant breathe or whatever or i can i know i can im aware i can but then i dont know how to explain i guess sometimes it hurts a few times it hurt or made me feel sick to breathe deep i think it hurt yea hurt not made me feel sick i think

my memory is really bad sorry

i dont really notice my heart beating faster only sometimes i have i think

the first time i probably had a panic attack i was on call to my boyfriend cant remember exactly what happened but i think after i mightve been shaking a tiny bit my hand at least i think

i have no idea sorry

i just im not sure if what i have is panic attacks of im just misdiagnosing it or whatever the word is my boyfriend and me are 16 and i know we dont know everything and we wont but knowing that i believe almost everything i get told sometimes

if he says its panic attacks or something then i say it is too but i have no idea if it really is and i just feel so horrible that i could be labeling it wrong or whatever i dont want what happens to me to be idk i just idk ig i dont want to idk call something that seems small something that seems big ig

sometimes i even want to have a panic attack i dont know why i hate it but i just want it to happen sometimes i dont know sorry im just rambling now",1

"how to solve this love problem back when i was 1st year college i fall in love with a girl she was unique and have similar features of my old girl friend the only difference is her personality is little tomboyish type of girl so i try to be friends with her but i kept my distance since the last heart break i felt when i was high school i still keep in touch from her time to time but not to frequently

fast forward 3 years we met again face to face this time we became much closer to each other but i still have the habit of distancing myself from women she gave me mix signal during out closure which is hard to know if she is really into me or not

so i tried courting her i pick her up and escort her to her house i gave her flowers during our graduation and gave her other stuff this stuff happen during may  sept the only thing that i havent given to her is confessing on what i felt on her",1

"having massive anxiety  help hi everyone

29f here so i have hsv1 since forever and 2 since being sad in 2017 after the sa i naturally freaked out and went to the urgent care and had them test me for everything negative except for the hsvthen a year later i got another test for everything including hiv and everything was negative except for hsv

since then ive had one sexual partner my boyfriend of 6 years about 2 years into dating he got a bad case of mono the doctor at the time tested him for everything and he tested negative for everything including hiv except for mono which it clearly was

anyway over the past month i lost my job the boyfriend left i had to move out with my dog said ex has been threatening me about the dog my grandmother got diagnosed with incurable cancer and has been having horrible hemorrhages that ive been cleaning up and i was nearly attacked by a random huge dog or rather i was and it was pulled off me before any real damage was done this was all in the first 2 weeks of june since then despite taking acyclovir a lot enough to delesion an elephant ive been getting cold sores threaten nearly every day none of them ever break the skin so far but theyre painful and an annoying thing to deal with other than thati havent been sick since i had covid a few years ago oh and mono in high school

so i went to the doctor hoping to switch to valtrex he tells me that in my blood work last year my monocytes were low at about 150 when they should be closer to 200800 and that infections cause them like maybe hiv i am now completely derailed

they did a bunch more blood work which is coming back tomorrow but i am just beside myself i honestly dont know if i can go on if i somehow have hiv which seemsunlikely right if anyone on the internet today has some extra kindness they could send my way a cornfed midwest girl having a hell of a time would really appreciate it",1

"first panic attack worsened anxiety hello about two weeks ago i experienced my first panic attack which resulted in me spending an evening at the er both spending time in the er and the panic attack itself were very scary  due to the uncertainty of the situation and the symptoms that came during it 

for context i have had anxiety since high school however it worsened during my freshman year of college i dealt with depression and bad anxiety during that entire year for a multitude of reasons and i thought that this summer would be the opportunity to relax and recover a month and a half into break the panic attack happens

i was officially diagnosed with anxiety two days after the episode and that entire experience has left me feeling emotionally distraught my panic attack had me thinking i was dying and since i have anxiety relating to death and health it was not a good combination to say the least now since that day i’ve realized that i’ve become a lot more anxious and am always assuming the worst

for people who have had similar experiences to mine what do you do to control your anxiety and change your ways of thinking i want to gain control and stability in my life and appreciate any comments thank you and apologies for the long post ",1

"constantly stressed does anyone else just feel like nothing can ever make you not stressed ever again meditation and any type of mindfulness only helps in the moment im doing them and i go back to being stressed immediately after

i 28 f have very little joy in my life and what i do have is far away my best friend lives like 200 miles away or ive lost motivation energy or interest i cant concentrate on hobbies for long and i dont really have money that i can spare to treat myself ot start any hobbies that involve money though i wouldnt consider my family bringing me joy they never visit me despite only being a bus journey away and i struggle mentally being in their house for a couple of different reasons and i just dont feel i can talk to them about any mental health stuff

i also dont have a job because of my mental health and thats one of the things that makes me feel like ill never have a normal life

it just feels like like i am in this constant state of stress and im literally having daily headaches to a point where i dont even know what its like to not have one

i feel incapable of letting any of the stress i have go and so it festers and manifests im starting to feel like a life without stress is never going to happen

"is stress the reason for my physical ailments hello i have had terrible years of trauma about 8 years of dealing with my dad falling sick from cancer multiple times and many other complications i was primary care giver during a significant event and also this 8 years was when i was young basically late teen to early 20s its been 3 years now and i have finally come around to excepting trauma and experiencing grief i dont know why it took me 3 years  
i think i am connecting physical ailments to this and wondering if they are related i have high resting heart rate 110 bpm and have had that for years i think i started to observe it in early 20s when i was still in the middle of the storm i have had all checkupstests done and my heart is healthy from physical perspective so far i thought that maybe its my normal but now i wonder if it is connected to stress i was under and the stress that had become my normal is that a thing i am not talking about high heart rate during panic attack i am talking about just a high heart rate is therapist a right person to answer this all medical reports come normal  
i have also been someone who would throw up after a stressful situation but these days i have terrible chest pain due to acidity and medically theres a reason ie i have hiatal hernia however i have had this since a long time and it never gave me chest pain now it does when i am kind of in the middle of processing trauma i wonder if this elevated symptoms are also connected to stress does this hunch makes sense

 i didnt set boundaries
 i tried to be the everything guy
 i didnt take care of my own wellbeing

 

and i suffered greatly from it

 

it took me a long time to realize a lot of the stress that existed in my life was caused by my own drive and not understanding what was important to me and what goals i really wanted to accomplish

 

i let everyone elses goals be my goals

i let everyone elses expectations or my perception of them be my expectations

 

it took a lot of personal work and deep insight into myself to climb out of that hole i had created i spent many years trying to understand myself better what was happening to me what i really wanted and what boundaries i needed

 

i didnt have a guide

i didnt know who to talk to about this

 

so i’m posting here today to remind you that you have control over your life you can make the change necessary to live how you want to live

 

and also one very important thing…

ive told her we shouldnt go too far tonight ive done that because i want to let her know that im pretty interested in her outside of just intimacy but i realized ill have to keep this promise which might be quite hard and this is where i feel like i dont know what the fuck im doing with dating im worried about how shell interpret it im worried shell think im not interested but im also worried im setting some sort of precedent that if shes nervous ill put aside myself for her which im happy to give love but i have a pattern of trying to fix the woman im in a relationship with

i dont know im very aware im probably overthinking it im also just quite anxious my life has been quite emotional recently and this kind of throws a bunch of chilli powder in a pot thats already stewing but yeah i have no clue what im doing i could do with some guidance about what to do if there is any

"for those with health anxiety  hey everyone 
i recently came across the term health anxiety  i had no idea there was a name for what i’ve been experiencing my whole life 

a year ago i felt like shit i had this gut feeling that something was seriously wrong with me 
i went to the doctor and listed ally symptoms and they checked my thyroid and i was mere weeks away from a coma because my thyroid was making me so sick 
i have since recovered 

then i fell pregnant  had a gut feeling that something wasn’t right i couldn’t shake the feeling and it turns out that i had a blighted ovum and was never pregnant with an actual fetus 

now fast forward to about a month ago i got this sudden rash on my nipples i’ve had it before it went away and i put it down to excema it’s back again 
i’ve also had weird breast pain and purple spots on my breast that resemble pimples and heal  but they come and go 

i think i spiralled into the breast cancer reddit page and i am now experiencing severe breast cancer anxiety
i now don’t know if this is seriously anxiety or if my body is telling me something is wrong again 
both times i had a gut feeling it was spot on  but i do not know if this feeling is a gut feeling or if it’s just anxiety 

how do you tell the difference  are there questions i can ask myself to calm it down  

i feel like it could be my gut telling me somethings wrong  not necessarily cancer but something is wrong in my body 
or it’s anxiety because it only started after seeing that first purple spot on my breast and everything coming up with cancer 

ps i have a doctors appointment scheduled for today  but i feel ridiculous telling them to test for cancer because i have a gut feeling but not really any symptoms to match it ",1

when i need to make my own decisions i feel so sick at the idea of not performing well enough or getting it wrong because something stupid inside of me thinks that i will get my ass beat for doing so i was not allowed to make mistakes my anxiety is almost exclusively physical so not only do i have to deal with being a reasonable person trapped in some neurotic idiot’s body but also the reactions and judgment from people who matter when they see a man crying trembling unable to speak turning pale like he’s about to be executed all over some dumb shit it’s emasculating too

i don’t know if i can live on my own my body thinks everyone’s out to beat me when my brain knows that isn’t true my nervous system is shot if i can’t live independently it’ll be crushing because i know my potential outside of my stupid body i don’t want to be the person who has all of this potential but can’t get out of his family house because he’s too disabled i’d be a failure to myself and my family i can rarely make the first step to receiving academic support and seeking resources because my nerves are so fucking shot therapy doesn’t help because it’s physical medication fries my brain and that was just the low end stuff plus i don’t trust it for myself i might just be stuck unable to succeed in a society that wasn’t made for people like me",1

didnt work either but thanks to psychotherapy i started doing slightly better i am off meds around 3 months now and today i started to experience these flows again to explain its not a classic panic attack people are usually describing i am not sweating no fast heartbeat no hyperventilating what is my problems are these super strong flows of darkness cant explain it better sorry connected with very strong urge to suicide i will not do it i want to live but not like this i also get super strong chest pain which feels like an elephant is sitting there

however while i was cleaning my butt a little more a water drop from the bidet went up to my nose or at least i think that it was to my nose since ive noticed it close to my nose and im now worried specially because of the chance that theres naegleria fowleri on it because its dirty water even through it has lots of soap bubbles too and it became dirty during a few minutes before i plugged the plug on my bidet

so now im worried about it through i hope that its just a fear and thats it

"the future feels so uncertain i’m lost i’m a 25f and i don’t know what i’m doing with my life i realize there’s people at all ages who feel the same way but i am genuinely so lost and confused and up until this point i’ve always believed that things work out how they’re meant to but i just don’t know

3 years ago i started a job that i absolutely loved my two coworkers became my closest friends and my boss was amazing he cared not many people are able to say that i loved that job and for 2 years i bent over backwards there eventually my two coworkers moved onto other careers and left me to take their place which was incredible i was so happy but i couldn’t run the shop on my own so i told our boss we needed another employee

he hired this lovely gal who i became immediate best friends with she was one of those people you feel like you knew your whole life

after a couple months i noticed my boss was treating her much different than me and letting her run the shop but she had only been there 2 months and i had been there over 2 years he started cutting back my hours completely and giving all my shifts to her i didn’t understand what was happening 

one day i come into work and she was already there she wasn’t scheduled she told me she had to talk to me confused we sat down and she just looked me in the eyes with this cold stare i didn’t recognize her anymore she felt like a total stranger not someone who i considered a friend she told me she bought the business and that i no longer had a job there we were never friends she just pretended to get what she wanted 

i still remember the feeling just sitting there in pure shock while she got up and left it truly flipped my world upside down

i packed my stuff up and i left that day completely unprepared for what to do next i didn’t have a job lined up i had no savings at the time just a side hustle i had been doing over the years that i figured i had to just jump full force into

i posted on my accounts that i was open for bookings and sure enough i was fully booked by the end of that week for a year i was fully booked running my business full time completely unexpected but it was meant to be 

with running my own business i barely spent time at home i was working truly 247 so burnt out i missed my dogs but i needed the money so i kept going that year goes by and sure enough my dog gets extremely sick she is so young only 3 she is my baby i rushed her to the vet and they said she’d need surgery and it would be something like 20000 i couldn’t afford it i had already got myself into debt and couldn’t qualify for any loans or credit cards i had no one able to help me out they said the only other option was humane euthanasia she was in pain

i said goodbye to my baby that day and every single day since i am just consumed by the guilt of not spending enough time with her there were so many days i’d be gone and thinking about how i should be with her but i told myself she was so young and i still had so much time with her but that was not the case

going back to work became impossible i didn’t want to be away from my other dogs i developed severe anxiety so every time i leave the house i am basically staring at the clock until i can rush back home

it’s almost been a year since i lost her and it’s gotten so much worse to the point where i am just cancelling plans appointments bookings etc so i don’t have to leave my house and my dogs i’m working just enough to cover my bills and that’s it which isn’t a lot because i’m still living at home

my job is a constant reminder of the awful past couple of years i’ve had and i need to move on i’ve been applying for jobs for a year and am hardly hearing back and i have no idea what to do from here and i have no idea what my future looks like 

the other thing is my husband has found a job here that he loves which is great and i’m so happy for him but i don’t want to live in our town anymore i haven’t for years i grew up here and i just don’t see myself growing here it’s not somewhere i see myself raising a family or just being happy but he loves it here and has made it quite clear to me that he doesn’t see himself ever being willing to move

we’ve had many discussions about it and we have never be able to come to a compromise

i’m just feeling really uncertain and sad and doing things on my own isn’t an option because i don’t want to leave my family or my dogs or my husband",1

"difficult timing  im currently dealing with the loss of a friend of over eight years she recently left a place we used to work at together due to being hurt by a comment someone made towards her she often has difficulty resolving conflicts and as a result she abruptly left shortly before her departure she called me and told me about the plans she had at the job i found out that she didnt really want to leave as she told everyone it was for a different reason she was just unable to resolve the situation 

 ive seen her in public once for sure and possibly today at the supermarket since we dont live far from each other the first time was on a check outline once she realized it was me she moved away quickly to the next line the second sighting possibly today she saw me as i was coming down an escalator at whole foods and she turned around facing the produce and texting on the phone the reason its hard to recognize her is because she always wears a mask and a hood or a hat 

the somewhat funny thing is that we both have social anxiety and she wont reach out to me and vice versa however her absence has really triggered me i was already having a difficult time prior to this and this just gave me the boost i really needed sarcasm  to be honest id never thought id miss her so much and im having a difficult time reaching out since shes avoiding me i thought itd be better to just give her space 

i know not reaching out to her is due to my own fear of loss coupled with the fear on her face from seeing me and her detachment from me and others in that space

as i mentioned im currently struggling with my own anxiety and im going to therapy and going out with friends and overall trying to keep busy i know these things take time  this relationship is just something thats been constantly eating at me for a while and making my face go like this  thats my going insane face

i guess im just writing this as a form of trying to cope any thoughts opinions etc would be appreciated thx",1
"repressed traumalong but idk where else to go 
34f ive struggled with my mental health since as long as i can remember i believe it began when i was molested by a friend of my mother  step father when i reached out to a friend to explain what had happened to me it was reported to school but not the police no clue why i remember my mother bringing me to a therapist but staying in the room the whole time i wasnt allowed to get the help i needed my mother made me lie to the school and the therapist saying i made everything up i did because i was afraid of hermentally  physically abusive alcoholic because of all of that i am afraid to trust any professional i still dont understand how my mother was able to manipulate everyone involved that i made it all up i remember the smell of his shitty cologne the coors can that was left on my dresser and having to scrub blood out of my underwear the next morning because i was afraid to tell anyone what happened it had to have been my fault in some way at least thats what i felt at the timei started cutting my wrists thighs and carving words into my legs a few attemps of overdosing on my mothers pills drank what i could steal from her stash something happened at some point in time where i just kind of snapped myself out of it to force myself to get better i repressed the memories of being molested and abuse from my mother learned to deal with my mental healthpoorlyon my own without a therapist and never told another soul about what happened not even ever to my husband


fast forward to my first pregnancy

 i had ppd with my 1st child but it turned into something so different for me mentally feeling like i was outside my body running on auto pilot constant need of praise or some kind of encouragement that i was worth living i started drifting back into my depression days after birth and then it became something so much worse i felt detached from the world not remembering anything all my days felt like they ran right into one another but at the same time felt never ending it was a terrifying experience to have to go through and i wouldnt wish it on my least favorite person in the world

i struggled to talk about any of my feelings even with my husband huge mistake i wanted to pretend the thoughts werent there and i managed to convince myself in some ways that i was okay mentally i remember feeling like i couldnt come to my husband with everything because i was afraid he not only wouldnt of understood but may have just up and left me completely  ive always been broken and i didnt want him to see me that way in the mix of all of that i let another man into my life not physically in anyway huge issues with men putting their hands on me in anyway because of my past but he flirted with me at work alot and it got to the point where i flirted back it became an emotional affair as far as why all i can remember is wanting to feel desirable and appreciated looking back now im sure i was disassociating  i needed an escape from my thoughts never in a million years would i have thought i could do anything like that but i did and i will never be able to forgive myself for it i should have brought up my past with my husband at that point at least to try to make him understand that i could never cross that line physically but i never did i still fucked everything up by even talking to someone else so would it have even mattered at that point 


most recently my husband brought up a time where i was pregnant with our second child where i apparently got in my car drove into the yard and said i was going to kill myself i have literally no memory of any of that my question is what type of mental illness can cause memory loss to that point it clearly was a huge event in my life but why cant i remember it hearing about this pushed me into looking for help is it similar to other repressed memories i have i feel so lost and am terrified of remembering more about my past i still havent been able to bring myself to talk to a professional so i havent been officially diagnosed with anything i was diagnosed with major cronic depression from my family doctor before i even became pregnant with my 1st child i took meds for about a month but had bad side effects so just stopped from what ive read onlinecountless hours researching i could even have a few different mental illnesses i have alot of the same signs for borderline personality disorder depersonalizationderealization disorder dissociative identity disorder anxiety and major depression i dont know where to even start with getting help because of how paranoid i am about talking with a therapist i know i need to so i can get the help ive needed for so long but im terrified

"stress boiling over i have definitely gotten myself into this situation i knew better than to trust my mom but i hoped against all that she had changed now my stress levels feel too much to handle how do i manage my stress

let me explain how everything started i 26f moved in with my mom 54 plus my niece and nephew ages 14 and 10 i moved in with them to help my mom financially and to help her raise the kids our agreement when i moved in was that i’d take care of all of the utilities while she covered the rent

she screwed me over when she quit her job and stopped working leaving me to try to cover all of the expenses which was well over my income she was already behind on rent found this out later the 12 grand usd she got from income taxes that was supposed to pay me back and help us she used it all on drugs in one week for that matter

long story short we ended up getting evicted becoming homeless my dog and cat being forced to live in a car a month later and things are finally looking up i’m close to hopefully getting a place i’m working on getting custody of the kids and i’m hoping to get my babiesmy dog and cat back into a stable home away from my mom

"the worst anxiety of my life hello 
im age 22 desperately looking for help from everyone who sufferedsuffers from anxiety or a panic disorder 

my story in short form is that i had panic attacks since i was 10 in moments where i felt trapped and couldnt leave the place easily classrooms crowds of people train drives …
with therapy i could handle it and became a nurse to help other people with this problem 
june 2023 something changed i drove the train home and suddenly had the worst panic attack of my life i had so many panic attacks and never experienced this type of fear before 
since this day i was never calm or relaxed 
for weeks i couldnt leave my house but even in my safe space i have unimaginable fear 
i‘ve tried different antidepressants right now im taking 100mg sertralinezoloft my mood is better but the fear is the same 

im in therapy but it is not helping because i cant even explain what im afraid about im scared of everything its like my brain is permanently ready to fight something and i cant turn it off or calm me down at the same time i have the worst derealization feelings 
it has almost been a year since i last felt safe and im scared its gonna be like this forever 

i started to think if it was a physical reaction 
because why did it happen so suddenly and why am i not able to control it even though i have so much willpower 
i always had an iron deficiency but the last time i got it checked it was just slightly low
could it still be that 

sometimes its calming to read similar stories especially if they have a happy ending 

if anyone has a tip i would be so grateful
i want to live again 

i hope you are well

"this is your friendly reminder that sleep is wonderful for health anxiety so ive been dealing with a period of worse health anxiety for over a month now and the number 1 thing that has helped me fight my way back to normalcy has been completely changing my sleep habits going to bed early not eating right before bed having a calming bedtime routine getting 9 hours of sleep if possible etc stress can be soooo taxing on your body and can make you notice even more symptoms if you dont let yourself rest and recover i still have my rough moments but i can tell im doing way better than a few weeks ago because im not running on fumes all the time also in my specific case the thing causing my anxiety was a muscle sprain and those types of injuries heal better when you get enough sleep so its extra important lol 
i know its super tough to sleep well when youre focusing on how bad you feel but you can practice and get better at it trust me sometimes i have to take melatonin or put on soothing background noise to get to sleep but once you do thats the hardest part over and noticing that i feel genuinely better after a few nights sleep is pretty motivating
anyway this community has been helping me get through a lot lately so i hope you all have a wonderful daynight and are taking good care of yourselves 3 and get some sleep haha",1

"underlying stress and how to deal with it hey there  
  
so ever since i was a kid my hands have always been shaky i just figured it was a normal thing for me every time i went to the doctor about it theyd give me some vitamins mostly vitamin d because you know norway doesnt exactly have sunlight in abundance but none of that seemed to help  
  
then when i was about 16 i started having trouble breathing the docs thought it was asthma and gave me an inhaler which kinda worked for a bit but lately lifes been throwing a lot at me long story short i found someone i really care about but my parents totally disapprove cue endless arguments roadblocks threats and even some physical stuff and now on top of everything im getting what seem like panic attacks my head feels tight my hands shake even worse and i can barely catch my breath  
  
when i finally went back to the doc about it she just said its probably stress makes sense given everything thats going on but weirdly i dont really feel all that stressed out still therapy seems like a good idea problem is its expensive and my student budget isnt exactly on board with that im hoping i can find some help at the university where its free but until then i guess ill just have to tough it out

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress  i’m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really don’t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesn’t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i don’t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 

so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told she’d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and i’m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool they’ll be home when i’m home oh no i get yet another text saying they’re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasn’t allowed back for the 5th time it’s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like i’m not being told everything 

this has caused me so much stress it’s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also haven’t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later i’ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 

i haven’t eaten since saturday i’ve not left the house in 2 days i’m signed off sick from work for a week i can’t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations i’m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i don’t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 

i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and it’s to the point where i’m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is “safe from things like surgery and icu” it’s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says it’s too much tv but i can’t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i don’t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me

severe nonstop anxiety help i’ve had anxiety for as long as i can remember but the past couple years i guess it’s been really bad from a day to day perspective i always feel like i’m in control and normal but things keep spiraling out of control and it feels like i’m watching them spiral without being aware the moment i wake up there’s a never ending swarm of thoughts in my brain that i can’t control and it feels like my body’s in a constant state of panic i can’t do anything i want to or say anything i want to without being bombarded by my own thoughts and i never have a clear stream as i write this i delete every other word because my thoughts get jumbled so i rarely make any sense unless i take hours to craft the message from the outside it looks like i’m doing incredibly well i go to a top university have a high gpa and have some friends but i’ve it feels like i’ve been running unconsciously for the past 4 years my brain’s able to complete assignments and cram information to spit out well enough to ace tests or hold passing conversations but i don’t process any of the information no matter how hard i try it feels like i’m trapped in my own mind watching my life through my eyes and seeing my body move but i’m not in control i don’t want to live like this anymore i have a therapist and psychiatrist but any action i take gets interrupted in a week or two by my thoughts taking over and i lose all my control again i need some advice please help ,1
" is it with worth doing if something is guaranteed to make you depressed and anxious while doing it something i’ve been thinking about lately

if there’s something you’d love to do and would give you a lot of happiness…but it requires finding a compatible person to do it with…but the probability of you succeeding at finding such a person is low…and tying and constantly failing or just the process of doing it is guaranteed to make you depressed and anxious…is it worth doing

is it worth doing if you get brief periods of happiness interspersed with plenty of anxiety 

is better to try to maximize happiness with a low probability or minimize anxiety and depression with a high probability",1

"update on my symptoms don’t know if i should be concerned if i have gastroparesis mcas gallbladder h pylori etc or if it’s all just from stress also noticed few petechiaes on my arms today i’m free from having diarrhea or stomach pains but i still have to be very careful what i eat as i feel most foods cause acid reflux making me feel pressure or as if i have a lump in my throat and crazy belch burping and i still get gassy at times or even burning in my stomach some food make me have to use the bathroom right away and everytime i have a bm i get crazy cramps i see when taking zantac and antidepressants symptoms ease down also see when my anxiety is lower or once it’s night time and i’m laying in a dark room symptoms are not as bad i got my period which is causing me to feel a bit of my stomach pains and all symptoms a bit more also i notice during this period i have many blood clots lastly don’t know if it’s from taking zantac and clonazepam so often that i notice a few petechiaes on both my arms like 34 each side space out don’t know if this is all from stress ever since this started i’m scared 247 that i’m going to end up in the hospital or die besides having to deal with other stressful things in my life and vertigo 

week  ago went to the bathroom mushy and almost diarrhea twice i did eat cooked carrots last night had mircogreens with salmon for breakfast and less then a spoonful of yogurt don’t know if that’s why i’m going like that today as of right now really no stomach pain 

yesterday woke up belch burping like crazy but had no pain in stomach just gassy at times could eat more today but notice for awhile now i get acid reflux and depending on the food could be worse and only time i feel some pain is when i feel above my belly button when i press in i get a weird  dull pain then it fades away overall i’m belch burping a lot and having lots of acid reflux and burning in stomach on and off i could burp for an hour straight even without eating anything i know my period is due in a few but i’m concerned i could have h pylori or stomach cancer i saw many young people have stomach cancer in their 20s

other day still belching not as gassy in the moment above belly button still feels a bit weird but pain went away and toward the left side a bit feels like a balloon at times then i belch and feel better overall don’t feel as bad as last night under belly button it is sensitive to touch a bit have burning in stomach after eating 

yesterday was feeling better even had somewhat of a normal bowel movement later on i pressed right above my belly button going a little bit to the left and i got a dull burning pain going up a bit and around belly button and now it hasn’t left and i can’t stop belch burping again i have been taking zantac and it has been helping me keeping that pain bloated gas feeling away but not so much today maybe it’s also because i took ibuprofen and also i do not have a fever but my period is due in 8 days basically it feels like someone punch me in the stomach now 

say before stomach feels kinda better today went to the bathroom felt like i had a wall on the side of my rectum with sharp pain went very small stool and sorry for the tmi but it smelled horrible besides that my face has been feeling flushed took my temperature and it’s between 100 997 i’ve been highly stressed and my vertigo has been really bad today stomach overall as i said feels a bit better but kinda also feels like someone has punched me in my stomachlower abdomen 

few days ago light sharp pain around my belly button that goes down to my uterus kinda and light pain around the belly button especially when pushing down around my belly button it feels funny weird light sharp pain and lower stomach pain area pressing around the area feels sensitive hurts a bit near my hips down gassy and feeling slightly better after burping also symptoms could act up more after eating or when feeling more anxious took zantac last night helped me a bit

"ways to manage anxiety and depression  hi all

i suffer from anxiety and depression but got it under control in my adult years 20 upwards with alcoholpointless sex with hookersdrugs and masturbationi became an extremely outgoingarrogant person with alot of friendsi know alot of people can relate to thatfor 10 years i had things under control and it took a few lost business dealsbreakuplosing a sibling and i completely unraveled where the very same things that use to calm me resulted in chaos and even more anxiety

as i’m typing this i feel abit better and taking it one day at a timeiv been going through the worse mental health with depression and anxiety for over a year but have only recently managed to get better

things i would suggest

1stop drinking
2no porn  masturbation 
3force yourself to be outside each and every day even if it’s completely unbearable
4have a checklist for the lil thingssmall victories straighten the mind make your bedbrush your teethtake a shower clean and do the dishes
5physical activity before leaving homedo a few pushupssitups or weights just to get your dopamine levels up
6try and find a way to do the things you enjoy insidebut doing them outside readinggaming etci usually take a book with me when i leave the housefind a place and read 
7go for a walk atleast once a dayleave your phone in doorswalk around the block and just clear your head
8pray if you don’t believe in godjust find a time before you sleep where you can kneelclose your eyesreflect on your daywhere you are and where you want to be mentally and also in other aspects of your life
9take a break from social media or remove any negative pagessubs or people from your timeline


these things are not medication for our illness but they sure do help abiti’m definitely no where close to being complete ok but atleast i don’t want to kill myself now

ps i’m not a phycologist or a mental health gurubut someone also battling and it pains me to read your messages and i hope i could do more to help cause i know how it feels

spreading loveblessings and healing to all of you ❤️

dae let accomplishment or lack thereof… ruin their days is anyone else’s sense of self worth spoiled by days when you just accomplish nothing and by nothing i mean days when you’re ready and willing at least in theory… to get shit done but either through psychological coercion you find yourself having no energy andor feel under the weather and do nothing the whole day but check your email ignore any responsibilities but scroll through reddit and play video games i mean i took my medicine and brushed my teeth but that’s about it i have so many obligations and i’m 53 years old and a homeowner father and husband etc but i feel like i’m never going to accomplish anything with my life because days like this are just small scale examples of my life as a whole i think that i just need some encouragement and maybe someone to tell me that i’m not the only person who feels like this ,1

"i messed up at work this was a few weeks ago i’m an assistant teacher split between three schools the other day i was helping students with speeches which many of them hadn’t finished due to messing around in the prior lesson at one point since no one was volunteering to go next i started grabbing name tags from a pile randomly

students started cheering when someone else’s name was called and getting nervous they’d be next i found it hilarious as it was done humorously and helped people with their speeches where i could it’s an esl class

so i went to my other school and mentioned this to a few other teachers how around half hadn’t finished their speeches and the method i used partly because i found it funny partly because i was a bit frustrated with the very rowdy class i even briefly mentioned the tag method to a teacher during class i don’t think in went into detail about the unfinished scripts maybe said some people weren’t preparedvolunteering don’t think i le mentioned the year level this was while students were doing other activities so it wasn’t directed to them

it only occurred much later that it was a shitty thing to do i didn’t name names or even say which class it was two classes per year but these kids would be entering this school next year and i don’t want to give them a bad rep even if they are little hellions a lot of the time i’m back at the school i talked in tomorrow and i’m going to try and talk them up to the other teachers hopefully undo my words if i remember correctly i did correct myself in conversation to say it was more like a quarter hadn’t finished and that some kids had done very well


i feel like a failure of a teacher i’m so frustrated with these kids they are so smart and it shows when they put in the work last lesson they actually settled down for once and it was amazing",1

"how do you manage your anxiety when you know factually things are about to go wrong and be really hard  basically the title i had a bunch of financial setbacks and am having to move to a shitty tiny apartment building with some highly questionable structural concerns i know this place is a mess i know itll be extremely difficult to fit any furniture through the hallways and door i know the only moving truck i could on such short notice is way too big for the limited parking options in front of the  building and be blocking someones driveway one way or another

i only chose this place in particular because i was panicking scared i was heading towards the path of eviction or even more severe debt that i couldnt possibly keep up with and i didnt want to end up homeless and sued by credit card companies or something so i found the cheapest place that at least looked halfway decent inside the unit itself and very hastily decided to sign a lease and pay then my non refundable security deposit and first months rent i had been in severe panic mode while i made this very rash decision and i wish i could go back and tell myself to at least look at another couple of apartment options before signing and paying but i cannot change that now



so my question is when you know factually a lot of things are definitely about to be super rough and uncomfortable but you have no other way than to see it through how do you cope theres a million other worries i have about things that could potentially go wrong and ive been using some guided meditation to help me sort facts vs feelings but its just facts that some things absolutely will go wrong and will suck and stress me out further",1
"gabapentin withdrawal and the aftermath im currently towards the end of gabapentin withdrawal i was originally on 1200mgday which went down to 800mgday about a month ago then around a week ago or so i went to 400mgday and was planning on just dropping it to 0 from there but i felt awful i talked to my doctor and he pretty much set up a taper for me where we were dropping 100mg every 3 days  today is my last day of 100mg so im going off it after today

as ive approached the lower end i seem to be noticing my depression and especially my anxiety spiking i havent had much as far as the cold sweats though i do seem to have somewhat of a temperature sensitivity  like i feel like shivering when its slightly cool and in the shower going under hot water is a bit more sketchy ive also been staying up later and ive been having a lot of fatigue  feeling like im weaker than usual

my question is probably for those who have gotten off of it do things return back to normal after the withdrawal or does it seem like things have changed im just wondering if once the withdrawals are done if it will leave a noticeable gap in my meds that i will need to address or if things will go back to normal

in all honesty i never felt like it was really doing anything for me when i was taking it i couldnt tell the difference so any benefit it had was probably masked i also took it at night before bed so i may not have known what it was doing for me

anyways just wondering if anyone has any experiences they could share with getting off of it ive only been on it for a few months so i feel like im having less withdrawal effects than some of the horror stories ive read but i was just getting opinions on how it goes",1

"ive been experiencing anxiety and paranoia since breaking up with my manipulative girlfriend we met four years ago everything was fine while we were friends but i always felt like there was something wrong with her even back then she often did not make eye contact would turn her head away when i tried to make it and had no known psychological or physical problems i knew her mother was bipolar and that she grew up in a notsohealthy family but these never caused me to approach her with prejudice because i started to like her the moment we met i ignored the voice inside me that said something was wrong

this girl always told me that there was an emptiness inside her that she felt like an empty shell most of the time and that situations such as love and being loved aroused foreign feelings in her but she did not associate this with being asexual in fact once after a lecture she took at university she tweeted something like that the narcissism symptoms her teacher told her suited her very well im not making any comments about it im just quoting something she said

we dated for a year and everything was fine at first but it really changed after a disaster that happened to our country and especially our city was greatly affected she was constantly starting small fights for reasons i wasnt even aware of and as i tried to listen to her in these fights calm her down express myself and apologize by approaching her calmly she put me in a bigger cycle of apologizing i was so worn out during all these fights that i was having fits of shivering under my duvet at those moments she seemed to me that she could disappear at any moment and i couldnt even express my own resentments due to the fear of this because i was in love with her so much likewise when i expressed my own resentments i was the one apologizing at the end trying to suppress my shivering fits under my duvet

i had sleeping problems for the year we dated  there was no such problem before we started dating and it got better after we broke up i lost seven kilos my migraine attacks became abnormally frequent and many other problems appeared in my body sometimes i couldnt sleep for days moreover i had a very serious exam this year and i had to give all my focus to that exam and she knew it she still started fighting at least once a week ruining my focus for the day

at the end of a year when i was hoping that everything would get better and that one day we would both recover and continue our relationship in a more peaceful way one night she suddenly broke up with me and said that it would be better if we stayed friends exactly after that i looked back and was able to realize all of the bad things i had experienced throughout the relationship and after about two months i texted her about everything i realized during our relationship and blocked her i said i will send her belongings somehow in my house and also told her not to reach me anywhere i was so tense and anxious that i couldnt even wait for her to text me back and blocked her in every platform  but the next day she came to my house and left the gifts i gave her and a letter at my door she didnt knock on the door my mother found the bag throughout her letter she was just accusing me of fancy descriptions telling me something about being alone for the rest of my life

since that day i get nervous every time i go out i feel like that girl will meet me from somewhere and my anxiety is out of control sometimes even when i am alone at home i get the feeling that she will somehow manage to get in from the balcony and jump out of one of the rooms and it takes me a long time to calm myself down and get out of bed shes been in my dreams every two nights since april and my anxiety is out of control not only in this regard but in every other area of ​​my life and i cannot receive psychological therapy until october i dont know what to do im open to all suggestions to calm this anxiety and paranoia",1
balancing feedback honesty or encouragement exploring personal perspectives in professional settings have you ever conveyed to a student patient or client that they possess belowaverage or average intelligence emphasizing the need for hard work in a specific endeavor alternatively have you ever expressed to someone of average or belowaverage intellectual ability that they exhibit a high intellect possibly as a means of encouragement or do you consistently opt for a more positive approach potentially sugarcoating feedback i ask for your candid honesty in my personal experience my psychiatrist eventually mentioned my high intellect during our sessions but i find it challenging to trust such compliments suspecting they may have been tailored to meet my expectations and encourage continued sessions and financial investment its solely my perspective acknowledging that my opinions are my own concern i seek clarification on this matter,1
"how did you choose your therapist gender wise first therapists i’ve seen have been recommended for me now i am looking for a new therapist and i am unsure in how to choose the right persona

starting from gender i am a male and have seen male therapists i feel that male suits me better but not sure why maybe learned models from my parents both were distant but mom was more cold whereas dad was kind of safer when he was around died to alcoholism later

should i go with gut feeling and with the option that feels more comfortable male or the opposite because it can be more related to my issues with mom for example

"the three keys to make your success inevitable the three keys to make your success inevitable



as someone who has been a hair puller and skin picker since the age of twelve i know how hard it may seem to stop i know how easy it is to fall into the helplessness these disorders bring into our lives i also know the toll it can take on your mind and emotions when you fail and feel that you can’t stop but can’t is a dirty word it is a choice you make saying you can’t gives this disorder full control of your life and actions but you are the captain of this ship not your disorder you are able to figure anything out to do this first believe you can 



if you keep these following three keys in mind when you work towards stopping your picking and pulling you will find success it will take time commitment and a lot of action with that being said here are the three keys to making your success inevitable



key one you need to be fully committed to stopping 

in order to stop picking and pulling you must be completely and utterly committed to doing the required work to do so you have to give 100 of yourself to attain this goal or else it won’t work out anything less than 100 is not good enough and you’ll fall into the gap of failure in which you’ll be stuck it’s that simple if you do fail get up and try again don’t take the failure personally you are trying different things and they won’t always stick right away but if you’re giving it your all you will succeed just keep taking action and moving forward and you’ll get to your destination in perfect timing



key two take committed consistent imperfect action every day to stop if you are not in action you are not committed

when you take action it doesn’t have to be perfect it needs to be committed consistent and imperfect because you are a human navigating a human experience of a disorder that is temporarily paralyzing you but if you take steps daily to move out of it you will succeed in perfect timing no one is going to expect perfection from you that’s your own expectation and it’s not realistic even taking small actions is better than nothing so focus on doing doing doing whenever you get the chance it all adds up at the end



key three burn all bridges that can lead you backward you are committed to stopping therefore there is no going back

i’d never heard of the phrase “burn the boats” have you if you haven’t it basically means to burn all paths backward in order to move forward remove any possible avenue that involves not stopping as they will never lead you to your goal once you start working towards stopping your picking or pulling there is no going back if you truly want to stop you must fully commit yourself to doing it you simply don’t allow yourself to go back if you fail you start again and move forward no matter what your mind tells you you refuse to take the failure personally and you use it to move you in a different direction for your goal your mind is always going to tell you to do the opposite of whatever action is actually going to propel you forward



remember lovely souls it doesn’t matter how you start what matters is how you finish just get started by taking daily action that is consistent committed and imperfect and don’t look back not even for a second you may have picking and pulling deeply engraved as a habit now but you can reverse it and stop i picked and pulled for nearly thirty years but with full commitment to doing the work to stop i’ve climbed my way out of that hole if you’re ready to stop picking and pulling but need some guidance i’m ready to stand up and guide you you have to be willing to be fully committed to doing the work reach out and we’ll discover ways to move forward let’s do this



in addition i have a radically awesome community with free resources and daily content that will help you to overcome this disorder i also have oneonone coaching options and i’m working on group coaching programs and courses as well you’ll find people who are struggling with hair pulling and skin disorders so you’ll make plenty of connections for the community you can check it out here  everyone is welcome

randomly january 2023 i had a panic attack out of no where felt like i was having an actual heart attack went to the er everything looked normal got discharged   i went on with life it was my first one ever 

august 2023 after going to six flags on the 6th on the 8th i woke up with random burning numbness tingling  burning throughout my body went to er they kept me overnight did a full work up cat scans mri  mra of my brain and neck and cervical spine i had some bulging disc c4c6 but all other results were normal so i chalked the burning up to that they released me and the pains went away some time after

september 2023  i started accutane isotretinoin  also birth control sidenote i was on birth control since 2017 after my son i stopped 2022  started back sept 2023 same kind

migraines started i had one every 2 months to date

december was where it all started i noticed a headache everyday didn’t think nothing much of it but it lasted for about 7 days on the 14 of dec i said let me check my blood pressure because maybe my head hurts because of it i got a reading of 178100  then like 15894  this caused another panic attack went to the er bloodwork everything was good ekg  etc they gave me fluids i felt somewhat better chalked it up to being dehydrated from the accutane not drinking enough water and i completely discontinued the accutane this day and took my last shot of birth control after these events things started to spiral out of control 

i checked into to the er about 8 times in a 3 month  span  dec  feb  saw my primary  who said it was anxiety  tried to put me on meds that i refused i had more mri w contrast this time of the brain the only thing that changed from the last one was a change in my white matter  a little dot  doctor said it could be from the migraines  

symptoms kept coming  i had soreness in my upper back  neck tightness went to get a corticosteroid shot because i thought the pain was from the bulging disc after felt like the pain in my upper back got worsti wasn’t sleeping  twitching in my muscles started  intense burning that started in my feet alll day that has now travel up to my thighs got more cat scans bunch of chest xrays i went to a cardiologist echo  stresss test  gastrointestinal doctor because of constipation everything seem to be good i  got blood work for ana lupus  rheumatoid etc that was clear i did pt but i felt like it was getting worst so i stop i would get burning in my head felt like a band wrapped around my head i lost 20lbs couldn’t look down i would feel dizzy felt like things weren’t real and most days i just wanted to cry and stay in bed 

march  april 2024 things weren’t 100 but they were better a lot of the symptoms subsided but the burning and muscle twitching persist

"you can stop having panic attacks right now probably heres how to do it  here’s how i stopped heart anxiety and panic disorder  
if you are in the midst of panic disorder and are having multiple frequent panic attacks maybe reading this will help 

i used an app called dare to help me here is the link on the appstore  also i have no affiliation with this app its just a random app a saw suggested somewhere on reddit that helped me get through this

there is a feature in this app for confronting your panic attacks basically you learn to embrace the attack and try to trick yourself into not fearing the anxious sensations you may still feel worried about the thing that worries you but you should start to stop fearing panic attacks ironically having panic attacks is often a bit connected to anxiety around anxiety you want the awful feelings to go away so bad it actually forces your body into fight or flight mode this is the panic attack its your body entering fight flight or freeze mode almost instinctively to prepare you for whatever it is you are afraid of 

fight or flight mode evolved to help us confront lions and tigers in africa millions of years ago it helped back then to get those adrenaline rushes when in danger to fight predators or run from them but now it serves little function against todays stressors and fears you cant outrun your fears you could maybe avoid them but thats not always a good or even possible option panic disorder is preparing you to confront your fear with physical strength or agility when all you really need is to remain calm 

thats the paradox modern stressors are not tigers and lions they are human ideas and concepts most of the time these days your fear topic is an idea not always an imminent danger confronting it requires you to be calm not ready for a battle to the death or  running from a lion

its important to lower your panic levels by embracing the anxiety and awful sensations funnily enough if you fear the awful sensations anxiety brings it actually makes the anxiety stronger you have to let feelings flow through you in fact you have to tell the panic attack to do its worst tell the panic attack to make you hyperventilation worse to make your heart beat faster to make you more nauseous to your chest tighter and limbs weaker tell it to get so bad it kills you why because you dont want to give a fuck anymore you are tired of having awful panic attacks you know they serve no purpose but your body thinks its saving your life keeping you in this state 

by embracing the panic attack you take away its power and potency you teach your body that it doesn’t need to shoot you with adrenaline because you don’t care anymore therefore you probably aren’t in imminent danger this may all be easier said than done but give the this and the dare app a shot as it has guided audios on how to do this through mental exercises they helped me a lot they also have a book if you like reading 

if you can do this your panic disorder will turn into an adrenaline rush instead its almost like the difference between falling from a height vs a roller coaster one causes adrenaline through real danger the other causes adrenaline through simulated danger this is what i went through at least and my fear was having a heart attack or a heart defect and the panic attack was convincing me for weeks that i needed to go to the er it was terrifying yet i overcame it by embracing the panic and teaching my mind and body that “i don’t give a fuck because im actually safe” 

 in my case i also realized that after seeing two doctors once at the er and being told im fine that i had done what i could and had to accept fate in the very unlikely chance that i really have an unknown heart condition i also wanted the panic attacks  to stop so i could actually react if i ever did have a heart attack that way i could distinguish between the two news flash panic attacks usually go away after some time or through comforting words or sensations bad heart attacks do not go away thats the main distinction i toke note of to stop worrying 

once you get through the sharpest part of panic disorder it gets better with time you may even be able to go back to feeling normal very quickly after embracing panic attacks and accepting the discomfort they and anxiety bring if you find yourself giving into a panic attack dont feel upset but just remember the panic attack wont hurt you its just primitive adrenaline a remnant from prehistoric times


also heres a small disclaimer this worked for me but may not work for everyone but you never know till you try embracing panic attacks made them go away for me who would have guessed it",1

i tried many different antidepresants until i started taking one that completly took the pain away i forgot about this for a really long time i had small flare ups sometimes but i was able to forget about it and carry on with my life two months ago or so it hit me like a truck again i woke up one night with horrible left arm pain and a numb back i completly panicked i had forgotten how these episodes felt and i truly believed i was about to die days later i went to the er got my heart checked and everything was alright went to the doctor about 6 times in a month i went to the er again two other times i wasnt able to do anything i was sure that i was about to die they uped my antidepresant dosis and it got a bit better although i still had symptoms and was still really paranoid that something was about to happen

currently im starting to feel really bad again its no longer so focused on my heart although the possibility of something related to it having to do with the sensations is always in the back of my mind i have uncontrollable burping and gas feeling of impending doom today i even puked i dont feel mentally anxious which is what makes this experience so horrible if i felt anxious i would believe that it is just anxiety but i have horrible physical symptoms i guess i have unconscious rumiating thoughts that produce me lots of anxiety that manifests physically instead of mentally i just want to know if someone has had a similar experience if someone has been completly sure that something cardiovascular was going on for months at a time for it to just be really bad anxiety i also kind of wanted to vent i didnt know to who i could express these thoughts ",1

i went to the dr with extreme brain fog mental confusion body tremors and teeth chattering its been making it hard to work and function normally its been coming and going since 2022 my most recent stint of these symptoms started on may 6th but in the past few weeks theyve gotten much worse so bad that my body is in agony yet all my blood tests heart tests mris etc have come back completely normal 

my dr psychiatrist and therapist have all basically told me i just have anxiety stress and a panic disorder but im not buying it the fact that this stint has lasted 2 months just doesnt add up to me and on the rare occasion that my symptoms clear up which happens randomly on occasion i dont feel anxious at all then i go to bed and its all back the next day 

i just dont see how all these horrible symptoms can last months and come and go like this for no reason especially without triggers i just want to be able to say something to my drs to make them reconsider and push forward with other treatments or testing instead of prescribing me the ssri and beta blocker they have now and just waiting and hoping it works these symptoms just seem too real and visceral to be something that lasts for months caused by my own brain

"walkingstanding does anyone have an anxiety issue where you get physically jumpy and weird body jolts only way i can explain it when talking with people even casually chatting nothing stressful at all i’m wondering if it’s a social anxiety thing i get these same symptoms at random times even when alone in my apartment sometimes but definitely more activated when i’m out and about an example i have very limited patience for when i have to stand and wait for something  even waiting for an elevator if it doesn’t come right say my body gets all tense and i feel these weird body jolts if people come by waiting for the same elevator the jolts and tenseness goes up even more also when walking i always feel like i’m off balance i have had some vertigo issues but i think this is more anxious related because it pops up when i’m walking to the train for work and definitely worse when there are bigger crowds 

i don’t have a therapist but i’m definitely considering finding one i just don’t really want to go the medication route because i know that brings up a whole other side of concerns for me would therapy help this kind of anxiety i know there are all sorts of cognitive behavioral treatments i’ve read up a lot on that but it never seems to work at least not in the moments when i need it to

"just got prescribed trintellix terrified of medication need some words of support if possible to see if i should start it i have quite debilitating anxiety and over the past couple months have began having some fairly intense depressive symptoms as well every day is a battle for me despite being an otherwise healthy 23 year old male who exercises regularly meditates eats pretty healthy and takes vitamin supplements 

i was on mirtazapine but it wasn’t helping enough obviously so my psych wants me to taper off the mirtazapine while starting on a small dose 5mg of trintellix he seemed to think this was the right med for me due to me having symptoms consistent with both anxiety and depression and also having a fear of medication that can have bad sexual side effects he said in his experience trintellix has lower incidence of sexual dysfunction i asked him about pssd from this medication he said he was aware of the condition and recognized it as a legitimate phenomenon but said he personally hadn’t experienced this happen with trintellix although he didn’t entirely rule out the possibility

should i start this medication is it safe what’s gonna happen to me i’m really terrified to take that first tablet but i also recognize that i am living in absolute misery due to my mental health and i need to address it in one way or another i do trust my doctor he’s an honest doctor and one of the only ones i’ve encountered who preaches about natural holistic approaches and only wants to prescribe medications when he thinks it’s absolutely necessary",1

"moving aches and pains  male37145st

never had health or any other form of anxiety before but i keep being told this is whats causing my problems im just finding  it hard to believe i suppose

all started 3 weeks ago when i found a 20p sized spot of blood when wiping this freaked me out and went to ae dr said he thinks he can see a haemorrhoid and it was probably that had a bit of tingling down there for 2 days as well didnt really reassure me though i need more than think when i see blood since then ive had pain in my groin pain in my left testicle and a slight tingling when going for a wee went to the gp for these symptoms and he thinks he can feel a vericolle or whatever its called got an ultrasound next month those achespains have since gone btw 

now for the past 2 weeks i seem to be having pain all over my abdomen and chest started off with me feeling my heart racing and beating out my chest thought i was having a heart attack if im honest then it was an ache down my left from below my rib cage to my belly button felt tight like something inside me was stretched out too much then had aches down my left flank then to my left groin and pelvic area llq area mainly hip bone feels tender on both sides got the same feeling in my lrq area today and slight tenderness in my upper middle abdomen none of these symptoms id said are agony pain maybe a 34 out of 10 they are normally constant but that might be because i cant take my mind off of what it is thats causing it last couple mornings ive woke up clammy and my stomach growling did the same after breakfast this morning too actually 

so after all that i guess my question is can anxiety cause pain that shifts constantly the pain only seems to be in a certain area for a few days then moves to somewhere else 

im constantly on google trying to figure this out ive had 2 poo tests 2 blood tests and 1 urine test all have come back negative for whatever they have been testing for apart from 1 poo test which im waiting results for there was a bit of mucus when i seen the blood so that test is still yet to come back gp has ordered another poo test to look for bacteria in my stomach collecting that today youd think the anxiety would be gone with all the negative tests but i cant help think something is being missed i really want an ultrasound but i dont think ill be given one

anyway thanks for reading my story so far haha",1

"hosting anxiety so i 34f have never been formally diagnosed with anxiety but i absolutely have it to some degree and struggle to deal with it in certain situations 

one that comes up often for me is hosting anxiety 

i cannot just sit still and enjoy the company i need to constantly be on the move cookingputting things back that are out of placetaking out garbagewhatever it is that keeps me busy just sitting and talking with someone face to face feels so hard for me so it’s easier to keep moving when i do it even worse is when my in laws visit for several days and stay with us while they’re in town i always just have that “impending doom” of someone being in my house so i can never totally drop my guard and relax just constantly anticipating needs wondering if they’re judging me about anything they’ve never given me a reason to believe they’re judging me putting my “hosting hat” on  it’s exhausting

couple this all with the fact that i have two young kids and when our whole extended family comes over with their young kids the scattering of toys and chaos all across the house makes me absolutely lose my mind i can’t focus on anything else besides that fact that x toy is now in the basement when it belongs upstairs all the legos are scattered across the living room floor…etc etc

"i want to talk about inside out 2 so this my be long but ill try to keep it brief also spoiler alert 

with that out of the way let me preface my condicion im diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and adhd both of my psychiatrists hab also suspected that im on the autism spectrum im 20 and have dealt with serious anxiety problems since i was 13 anxiety attacks extreme self loathing and panic attacks the whole lot im medicated and on the way to being somewhat normal

today i watched inside out 2 on cinema with my mother without being complicated this movie emotionally destroyed me not in the sense that it made me sad but in the way that the movie read me like an open book i could literally see my feelings reflected on the screen and my mom noticed this she held my hand through the movie for some context my mom is old school but shes extremely supportive and is the reason i was strong enough to get help she realized it was affecting me about half way through but then came the third act were rileys core became that she wasnt good enough this hit close to home a little way to much i was already tearing up but then came the panic attack scene and i crumbled it almost incited an an attack on me when the movie ended me and my mom walked out of the theater and the first thing she told me was so thats how you feel and gave me a hug

as an ending though this movie is now my favorite pixar movie not because its fun or entertaining but because it made a normal person sit in my shoes and see my feelings before this movie my mom try to see eye to eye with me and try to understand but clearly couldnt this piece of media made a middle aged neuro typical person understand what a anxietypanic attack feels like and now doesnt undermine its effect

my anxiety started really bad 23 months ago from a panic attack it got so bad i was scared to make my heart rate go up i was scared to have a shower or leave my bed from fear of having more anxiety etc etc fast forward 2 months and i’m still getting panic attacks here and there but i been dealing with it by telling myself nothing is wrong and trying to have a insane mindset of wanting it to happen and acknowledging it’s just physical symptoms and trying to ego challenge the anxiety it’s been helping somewhat as i have noticed my panic attacks are way shorter now but i also haven’t been outside the past 3 months until today every day feels like i’m constantly tense stressed etc and tingling and all of that but iv been managing to engage with activities inside like gaming and still acknowledging and trying to fix my anxiety by ways of forcing myself into anxious things to try and expose myself little by little i was just curious on if this is a good idea to go for i’m a bit worried that causing myself too much anxiety might lead me to a stroke or something like a heart attack as like i said i do feel constantly on edge and anxious i get andrenaline dumps until 10am until i eventually fall asleep sometimes so yea that’s just my question is if forcing myself into stressful and anxious situations little by little will be good for me i went outside today for only 3 minutes as i haven’t went out for 3 months i walked up the road stood still then let the anxiety sink in and could feel a bit of panic then i walked back inside but felt incredibly happy for atleast doing that feels weird since i was able to walk anywhere for hours a few months ago without a second thought lol",1
"work causing all my problems  as a retail pharmacist i work in very shitty conditions and the anxiety stress and ptsd causes me to be a completely different person and a complete asshole a year ago i was to the point of being suicidal because of all the pressure and lack of help  support i took time off on mental health disability and returned working for a different company 

things were pretty decent at said company but now it has become very similar to the old one i’m left feeling hopeless that it will ever change or that i’ll be able to find something different our district has been short pharmacists to begin with and 3 pharmacists just quit recently multiple pharmacies have been closing now due to the lack of any available pharmacists 3 months ago not a single one ever closed 

to add to the stress i have a disciplinary action on my record a final written warning due to accidentally leaving a narcotic on the counter at close which means i will not be placed in a permanent position in a store and cannot be promoted or anything until that falls off after one year this is in a district that is hurting for pharmacists yet …… 

i worked 34 hr per week floating and in jan told them i can’t work weekends until march 1st i started in june and have only worked 5 weekend days total since then the response was to immediately drop me to 16 hours a week on monday and friday only 

my life coach keeps telling me to change my thinking and have a positive attitude all the while i keep telling her that it’s because of this job that i’m a complete asshole and have such negative thinking when i’m not at work or working a different job i’m a completely different person due to finances i’m left in what feels like a situation that there is no hope of emerging from 

yesterday at work i came very close to that spot i was in a year ago today i woke up feeling good and forgetting about it and ready to enjoy my birthday then i had a counselor session followed by another one where all we did was talk about yesterday i hated the fact that today is my only day off and my birthday and i have had it stolen by spending the day talking about the horrible day yesterday and when i thought i was going to be able to chill and forget about it my wife scheduled a joint session with my life coach because she is scared and trying to help 

that just made me talk about it even more when i just want to be left alone it really made me angry and feeling hatred to the likes i’ve never felt before i’m not crazy stupid so not going to hurt anyone after the session i came home and wrote a note saying “stop fucking trying to help me i have never felt such hatred” and taped it to the computer i grabbed my phone ipad and switch and left i’m parked in the middle of a corn field alone which is helping i turned off find my location i think as an added take that 

is there any financial help for someone in this situation the honest solution is i need to find something else but i can’t afford to quit until i have found something else i’m scared that in the meantime the pressure is going to build to the point it pushes me over the edge

hi everyone i post here from time to time but my headspace is gotten so much worse i get so annoyed with myself but i cant stop the way im feeling

to set the scene i am a 24f and have been with my fiancè for five years we live in a three bedroom house with a small lawn important for later he makes the most money and as i am still studying i make next to nothing at my retail job my parents came to visit for easter and i was happy to see them but i work weekends too

now work has been hard as i pour so much effort into my job and i do things that are not required nor am i paid for to help improve it but my boss still always says its not enough and if sales dont improve the shop will close and im to blame its made my depression a lot worse i have been thinking of quiting as its making me suicidal but my dad says i give up to easily and that i must stop being overemotional hes always been like this one of the big reasons for my depression any way so when i come home after a rough day at work i am excited to see our pets we have two cats and one dog however over the last year none of them are really loving or want to be near me when i need them most

i talk to my fiancè but even though he listen he doesnt understand and his way to help me is to give me the basic solutions everyone always does go back to your psychologist change your pills etc

so work makes me feel useless my dad makes me feel like a failure for wanting to quit my fiancè makes me feel unloved and like he doesnt listen really or try to understand my mind then the little guys i care for uncoditionally ignores me

i feel like such a waste of space i think i need somethingsomeone who can provide me with love and attention constantly  i know its not healthy so i brought up the idea of getting a psychiatric service dog and my fiancè says its just another excuse to get more pets and more responsibilities

"dealing with the critics in your life whatever you’re trying to achieve  save the world write a novel devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour criticism is unavoidable your choice is in how to respond to it   
  
  
consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life  
  
clarify your purpose as humans we are compelled to make meaning making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived when you’re doing something very important to you you care far less about the criticisms of others if they can easily throw you off your path you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you are you living your purpose consistent with your values  
  
understand the critic’s motivation are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations their skill set their propensity for risk their values are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential downsides are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you them or both are they masking their own lack of action   
  
recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal we have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones we are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement people working against us over people supporting us most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it  
  
realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do whether you become a billionaire movie star teacher doctor or sit on the couch all day there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing so live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want  
  
respond calmly rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response respond kindly with a considered response acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making   
  
  
  
use your critics as motivation while some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines you are on the pitch and playing the game  
  
decide if they have something useful to say some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue if the criticism isn’t useful move on you have more important things to do  
  
take criticism as a compliment most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy you only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well if you’re taking a lot of heat you must be doing something correct

i was really pressured as im the type of student that need academic validation bc studying is the only thing i can do well but idk whats wrong with me these days i made a lot of silly mistakes copying wrong numbers from the question for example even my friends who usually get lower marks than me get high marks im so angry at myself for making those mistakes my parents use a lot of money and energy to put me in private school and i really need those marks to get into a university i feel so sorry for them

the more i get low marks the more i get anxious and the more i make stupid mistakes leading to lower marks plus i cant do anything when i get anxious its like a freeze mode heres come the social anxiety i replay every social interactions in my head and cant do anything tdy i complained my teacher about my result in front of the class now im too scared if my classmates or teacher might think im stupid or smth plus they might think that im not that good at studying

this is the worst grade i have ever received i even called my mom immediately and cried about my marks that was so out of my character i have never cried about my grades until this age pls tell me how to move on from the past mistakes bc thinking about them makes things even worse and how to stop making silly mistakes",1

"suggestions needed drug choice i have been struggling with chronic fatigue for 35 years currently i’m 50  i have taken a number of pills which only give me sides i took 25 klonopin nightly from 2002  2023 not sure it did much but took it out of desperation in 2016 had a bad spell and discovered remeron i never made it to therapeutic dose but have been taking 375mg for sleep and appetite  the past year been really struggling again i triedagain125 lex for a week then 25 lex for 2 weeks but fatigue and anxiety worsened so had to stop  this is 2nd time trailing lex had similar experiences with zoloft and prozac years ago i feel like ssris don’t work for me  i then tried bupropion for 3rd time  75 mg for 18 days i luckily did get honeymoon for about 10 days and thought i find a cure however it quickly turned and i started dry heaving and having massive anxiety so i had to stop  it’s been a little over a month with nothing but 35 remeron and i need relief  debating trying lex again since it has lower side effect profile or wellbutrin don’t really want zoloft since it causes nausea and i refuse to try snri my anxiety want let me go down that road  below is my psychiatrist write up from 2016  thoughts

b the biggest problem here seems to be poor tolerability of medications that could really be of benefit anxiety may be playing a role as such alternative tactics may need to be employed ni order to optimize his chances of achieving a beneficial dose of medication one approach would be ot use liquid transdermal or orally soluble forms of antidepressant medication along with low dose klonopin as a bridge and as a means of combatting treatmentemergent anxiety during upward dose titrations with this in mind recommend considering the following
c begin by retrialing an ssri ni liquid form such as sertraline starting at very low dose eg 625 mg daily with stead dose increases ni small 625125 mg increments as tolerated poor tolerability of these doses would perhaps implicate anxiety rather than direct sideeffects this can be minimized by using klonopin 025 mg bid scheduled rather than prn breakthrough symptoms ni between doses could prompt use of klonopin as a tdi rather than bid drug a partial antidepressive response to sertraline can prompt dose increases as tolerated fi antidperessive response remains partial and the sertraline or alternative ssri dose cannot be increased for any
reason then sertraline can be augmented with serial trials of bupropion if depressed mood low energy and concentration deficits are predominant buspirone if both generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms are predominant or selected atypical antipsychotics quetiapine aripiprazole or olanzapine
d fi step 3c is unsuccessful can taper and stop sertraline or alternative ssri and reintroduce mirtazapine 75 mg using the soltab formulation from there the dose can be carefully uptitrated ot 15 mg qhs would anticipate soporific effects at this dose partial antidepressive repsonse can be managed with dose increases as tolerated however fi this is not possible or fi oversedation complicates mirtazapie therapy can reintroduce bupropion sr 100 mg am increasing to 100 mg bid after 78 days as tolerated
e if step 3d is unsuccessful can undergo a therapeutic trial of vortioxetine which is mechanistically different enough from other serotonergic antidepessants though its profile for treating refractory depression is unproven
f if step 3e is unsuccessful it would probably be worth undergoing another therapeutic trial of tertiary amine tca following baseline ecg to rule out qtc prolongation imipramine can be started at 50 mgday as single dose at bedtime and increased by 2550 mg q 7 days until 1251500 mgday si reached this si a conservative titration strategy given uncertainties in how this drug will be metabolized given pharmacogenetic profile fi response occurs patients will show significant clinical improvement in anxiety physical expression of distress concentration and depressed mood within the first week on this dose fi these symptoms do not improve and there are no medical contraindications or manifestations of toxicity increase dose at rage of 25 mg q7 days to maximum dose of 300 mgday or until the patient begins to show improvement or experiences intolerable
adverse effects typically 1020 days of treatment at a target dose are needed before improvements in mood and affect become apparent improvement usually is first apparent to others before it is to the patient partial responses can be managed by optimizing the dose within its therapeutic range fi this is insufficient can augment with lithium 600900 mgd level of 0610 meql wel tolerated when titrated slowly from 150 mg or liothyronine start at 25 mcgd and increase to 50 mcgd if no side effects are reported contraindicated in
patients with recent mi thyrotoxicosis or adrenal insufficiency
g fi a therapeutic trial of tertiary amine tca si ineffective the medicine can be slowly tapered followed by an appropriate washout period in preparation for a therapeutic trial of oral maol the taper and washout period will last several weeks and can be an opportune time to provide psychoeducation regarding the maol diet and avoidance of interacting drugs consultation with the hospital or clinic pharmacist can be helpful here this time period would also provide ample opportunity to rehearse compliance with the maol diet

h
following appropriate washout of prior antidepressant and any potentially interacting drugs tranylcypromine can be started at 10 mg twice a day increased by 1020 mg per week until a target dose of 4060 mgday is reached if phenelzine si preferred ti can be started at 15 mg bidtid with a target dose of 4590 mgday poor
gastrointestinal tolerance of either may be treatmentlimiting should this occur can consider selegiline emsam starting with the 6 mg patch and increasing the dose as required to 9 or 12 mgd with emsam the maol diet
and avoidance of interacting drugs should still be practiced partial responses to maols can be managed by dose optimization or by augmentation with lithium thyroid hormone or atypical antipsychotics

"worried about my health tw  trigger warning

hey im a 20f and i am kind of worried about my health to give context i started vaping around december of 2022 when i say vaping i would vape for about 3 week max and give myself a month or even months before picking it up again when i had the vape it would not be throughout the day it would be a couple of hits for a period of time and then i would put it away for the day ive also had a few cigarettes but not back to back i fully stopped both habits recently because i realized its not the smartest thing to do and i should really look after myself

this being said

i have been experiencing some weird chest pain its dullpressure for the most part and i also find myself needing to take deep breaths it feels like my lungs are not expanding as much i also started working out again and have been lifting heavy so my mom thinks its a muscle strain i went to urgent care at first and the doctor said it was inflamed and gave me some prescription antiinflammatory medication he did an ekg and said it was normal and everything was fine i went to my pcp and my doctor listened to my heart and im also assuming my lungs and said its mostly likely asthma  i had a flare up in 4th gradeand gave me an inhaler to use she also said it could be anxiety which honestly makes sooo much sense

i did a stupid thing and have been looking up my symptoms and seeing other threads and have lead me to think that my chest pains and deep breaths are a lot more serious then they are even if i am 20 i plan on going to my doctor in the next week for a followup i either need a virtual slap in the face or some comfort i just dont know what to think or do",1

"advice please hi i’m a 21 year old female in the uk who has been struggling for a good few years now finally decided to take the leap to get some help early 2023 and have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression i’ve tried cbt with limited success and i’m now in active 1to1 counselling which is helping with developing techniques for when i feel at risk but day to day struggles are very much still there and not budging 

my counsellor recently suggested that it might be worth having a conversation with my gp about medication i’ve got family history and she feels we’re getting to the end of what she can do on her own spoke to the doctor today and was told in simple terms that i’m too young haven’t been trying for long enough to learn about my own brain and that because i’ve grown up in covid times the real world will now feel very stressful then has referred for more cbt i feel quite shot down as i just went in to discuss with her what options there are and i was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience where do i go from here am i too young she made it out that as i hit 25 my anxieties will just magically disappear but i’m slightly doubtful about that

"how do you break out of hyper awareness hello

i have health anxiety and it’s the worst as i’m sure you’ll all readily agree but one of my biggest offenders that haunts me even on my best days is that i am stuck in an endless cycle of ✨ hyper awareness ✨ 

when i’m really anxious being hyper focused on my symptoms makes sense like if i’m being vigilant about my rapid shallow breathing or profuse sweating 

but when i’m at rest and calm and having a good day i still will sometimes become suddenly fixated on a feeling or a symptom like “hmm this spot on my face seems kinda tingly or numb” and hours later i’m still thinking about it or “i think i feel lightheaded or dizzy” and i think about it constantly and consistently to the point where i really become dizzy 

i guess the purpose of my post is to see what others of you do to snap out of this hyper vigilance how do you know if what you’re feeling is actually real or if it’s so thoroughly focused on that it becomes real do you have methods to share i’d love to hear your answers so maybe i can stop creating more issues than i already have ",1
"at the time of writing this ill be 28 next week meaning im just two whole years away from hitting my thirties and to be frank with you im terified of that even more and then some its bad enough that ive just been spending most of twentieth seventh year just starting college and dealing with a lot of anxiety driven issues for the past two years with my growing older being on top of that but when looking back at these last eight to ten years and seeing how much i really didnt make much of my life after graduating high school back in 2014 its all really come to show how much i really didnt do much with my life being a man in his twenties was supposed to be that point in time where you supposed to have the best years of your life and living it to its fullest at that time doing all that has to be done and hopefully try to have an independent life with a family of your own and all that something that makes you more worthwhile to others

but instead i just got around starting college at 27 last year attending it with many students that are both younger than me and taken on top of feeling more socially awkward and out of place more than ever all the while still being a freaking virgin which honestly isnt really bad in itself considering all the while not much to my name outside of a license i havent made use of due to not having a car of my own or a home of my own doesnt help that all throughout these years ive bore witness to all these up and coming actors and actresses making more of a name for themselves while being around the same age as me and even have some be born the same year and even day as me too all the while im here wasting away in this crime ridden trash heap of a city that is memphis tennessee still

to add insult to injury all my cousins have been doing much better for themselves and have long since been independent for who knows how long and none of them never bothered to check in on those that they grew up with for years now and with a family so fractured and life screwing some of us over more than it needs to its just makes me regret not doing a lot more for myself after 2014 

it all just makes me more regretful of not doing more with myself as i went through life in my twenties and the times gone by so quickly i hardly feel like i even am an adult at times i still feel like im just reaching 20 and still trying to figure out what to do with my own life while everyone else around me has a clear path in mind while again being the same age as me instead all ive able to make up a lot of my time these last two years is a seasonal job that was the only one to hire me while others dont due to lack of experience a college experience that was as lacking as it was lonely and a couple reddit accounts with one banned for venting too much about things that i hated about my city and the bs that occurs in the world these last few years alone

"drug and alcohol treatment centers are often like luxury resorts but the hospital for any other mental issue is an atrocity why  anxiety has lead me to experience both

when i get overwhelmed alcohol is the only over the counter anxiety relief available its a horribly destructive solution but access to the real anxiety medication like atavan is like impossible these days

i found the best thing if the alcohol use gets out of control check into detox a nice place and get days of heavy benzos by lying about how long i have been drinking heavily

last time it was an impending hurricane that never hit but all that evacuation and chaos i went and got vodka to kill the anxiety and just function i neeeded it

then after a week of drinking it i am so sick two choices the real hospital that would lead to psych or alcohol detox

i dont think this is an antipsychiatry topic its a complaint antipsychiatry is a whole philosophical debate

i would never voluntarily go to inpatient psych its just abuse and no help

for example we can give you a visteril what the hell anxiety so bad i am in hospital and you offer me the horse crap pill the hardly does shit even for the worried well

"my story with anxiety  i have no idea if this text is going to be a long one or not but just wanted to share my experience

i have been dealing with anxiety for 45 years now it all started during lockdown
i was really healthy but suddenly i had to stop doing everything i loved like exercising going to the gym  crossfit and eating healthy

it all started when i had my first panic attack one night during quarantine i had a stubbing pain on my left chest side and i at first didnt get scared i over thought about it tho and convinced myself i had something going on with my heart when i had that thought everything just started right theni couldnt breathe i was shaking and thought i was going crazy i had to go to my mums bedroom to wake her up just to be sure i was going to be ok after that the next day as i remember was crazy  i was overthinking a lot  i thought i was going completely crazy bcs i couldnt get the last nights panic attack out of my head then the worst happenedi went into the state of dpdr which i have never been out of 

i feel like this everyday for the past years also i have symptoms and panicanxiety attacks every single day since then  which every single time they convince me im going to die which thats the fear i developed bcs of my panic and anxiety attacks and it makes it even worse  went to several doctors
 they find nothing went to the er i think abt 10 times  still find nothing did so many tests and still find nothing 

also went to psychologists the first one helped me for a short period of time right now im going to a new phycologist which makes things i can say better and also gives me tips my phycologist also recommended medication if her tips dont work on their own

but i still feel off and that something is wrong with me  i cant stop thinking about it which sometimes makes me feel like im going crazy 

all in all thats it  i will appreciate it if you leave your story and symptoms and give me more helpful information about what i can do to get out of this state

im looking to get pregnant in the next few months so obviously cantdont want to be on meds im doing meditation regularly and using musicexercise which help to a certain extent but i feel like im exhausting myself constantly trying to keep my mind and body moving as a distraction i desperately need to be able to sit with myself and relax

"at 16 huh so i’m 16 years old and i’m already having a midlife crisis of sorts the gist of it is this i dont think i have enough time left to do what i want to do who i want to be friends or be with or to even listen to my family’s advice or not

i’ve had a history of stressful situations like this even before today but i just kept it to myself because i didn’t want to open up even damn porn is getting the better of me its a shame i watch it at such a young age

i feel like i’m stuck nowhere to go to fucking breathe because what i want to do i dont feel like it’s going to work out after highschool

i’m scared i feel alone",1
"celexa vs lexapro i started celexa 4 months ago it was essentially like taking a tic tac every day it did nothing for me no bad side effects so that’s a plus but nothing helpful at that time i would say my anxiety was annoying but manageable my anxiety has worsened due to situational factors but i thought i was ok until i had a massive panic attack first one ever and ended up in the er this was last week and almost every day since i’ve had at least one panic attack 
i called my psychiatrist for an emergency visit and we switched from 20mg celexa to 20mg of lexapro  20 mg of propanolol as needed 
obviously it’s going to take time for the lexapro to work but i have some reservations about it they are such similar medications that i am worried that it’s going to essentially be more of the same i am desperate to get these panic attacks under control and i dont want to waste time with lexapro if it’s not going to do much anyone ever take both and have better effects from lexapro i also find it odd i went from the starting dose with celexa to the max dose with lexapro i was previously on zoloft at 50mg and i loved who i was on zoloft i just didn’t like the sexual side effects i’m almost willing to just accept them though if it will get me back to life as i knew it before all of this started
sadly i’m finding the propanolol just makes me feel bizarrely disconnected from my body and actually seems to make me more anxious so that sucks 
anyone have any advicesteps forward i have been in therapy as well",1

i regret a lot because of why i am like this i am an a student but due to these issues im barely hanging one good thing though is that i managed to get a in one of my recent papers others saay its tough to get a on this paper it was a confidence booster but the social anxiety and ocds have dried my life force so much that everythings kinda blurry i feel like im close to hitying my limit but not sure when for some reason i feel like to reach the end as i no longer want to take it as its tiring and burdensome ",1

"will taking medications without any consultation be safe so i have been suffering from depression and anxiety for a few years now but i am not able to get access to any therapists so i was wondering if taking anti depressents or any other meds that will help with my anxiety would help i dont have a proper diagnosis for what type of mental disorder i am facing or if i even have any but all the symptoms direct towards generalized anxiety disorder

so are there any meds that will reduce my anxiety and can be taken without much consultation also will there be any side effects i am not really aware of these things so i would like to know others people experiences about taking anti depressants how much it affects them and is it advisable to take them",1

"need a hug in a bad way and could use some hugs

today i got told i have “reversal of normal lordosis” in my cervical spine along with at least three levels of disc bulges as well as mild degenerative disc disease three things told in one day 

i’m only freaking 25 years old and i’m really struggling to accept these diagnoses because for one thing reversal of lordosis could be lifelong or a very risky surgery bulging discs in cervical spine may end up paralysis and loss of function of limbs in a few years hell i’ve even read that reversal of lordosis andor bulging discs can get so bad that they can even damage internal organs leading to lifethreatening complications or cause permanent nerve andor muscle damage or paralysis

i’m currently sitting in the toilet crying because it’s all been too much i’m only 25 but my body is falling apart and so is my health i have so many things wrong that are being diagnosed or about to be probably i’m scared that for some they’ll tell me they can’t do anything and i either have to die or live disabled andor in pain my whole life i’m scared 

my throat has been feeling weird for a week too lower and even upper like whole area but sorta raw from the inside and swallowing and speaking hurt a tad bit and are uncomfortable and i’m worried it’s cause i let my partner choke me a little last week during intimacy but at the same time also feels like some weird virus or bacteria but i don’t think so cause it started about the same time it doesn’t really go away i haven’t been to the doctor with the throat cause i wanna find a woman doctor and i couldn’t find one until this coming saturday cause there’s no way i’m mentioning to w judgmental doctor that i’ve practiced kinky stuff and oth my partner someone over message has already judged me for it plus my parents told me off

there’s a constant choking tightening weird knot feeling in my lower throat and sometimes upper middle throat since around the same time it happened last week and my brain thinks something is swollen there and i’m worried 247 that my throat might close up or something andor i have thyroid windpipe or laryngeal damage that won’t heal and will be permanent i’m so tired and sick of all of this i can’t have a normal life everyone around me is walking around healthy especially my age and i’m here barely keeping on surface and looking and feeling ugly now my life might already be in danger too

"anxiety to ocd hey gang 
idk what it is but basically i’ve been diagnosed with gad still suffer from it 10 years later everytime my anxiety gets intense  i start developing obsessive tendencies a doc once diagnosed it as ocd but i’m not quite sure they’re not necessarily intrusive thoughts that i have just a sense of disgust repulsion and agitation more often that not  from a specific person 

this person has fucked me over like no one else from an early age
so every time i’m around them my anxiety blows through the roof then my nerves and muscles get tense 247 this is also followed by the previously mentioned agitation and disgust it’s a kind of disgust that if i have to live with this person i find the entire place filthy i’ll spend hours cleaning everything if this person touches a table i find it repulsive and disgusting at times even nauseating if they shake my hand or i even so much as touch them accidentally i have to wash the area that’s been touched by them i avoid their clothing items at all costs even if they’ve just been washed 

this then tends to bleed into my day to day behaviors mood in which i just do multiple compulsions to feel at ease to no avail ofc

idk what it is but i just feel imprisoned and i’m sick and tired of it unfortunately i have to spend the next few months living with this person without access to mental health professionals

since ive moved into my apartment four of my immediate neighbors have died 3 of them in their apartments one of them in the same apartment as the first one corridor has 4 apartments total 

they just took the guy next to me out this afternoon every time i have a neighbor they go out in a body bag

i cant afford to move its hard as heck to find a deal like the one ive got here but this is anxiety central im trying to remain calm but its like wtf 

this guy was barely here a few months and he was fine so far as i know i did wonder at one point if he was doing some kind of drug because he was burning what he said was incense and it smelled rank whatever it was i dont know what meth smells like but i have to wonder if he was smoking something 

he went to the hospital a few weeks ago stayed for a week or so then came home and within a week he was dead 

i have to think that maybe these guys were all doing drugs and odd i just dont know because they dont tell me anything much probably for legal reasons 

i feel incredibly stressed right now but i have to remain calm and not freak out of course 

but who can just deal when in the past year and a half three neighbors have gone out in body bags and another has died in hospital 

this is why i am going back into therapy for my anxiety every time i start to feel vaguely  normal i have to deal with weird shit like this

"worriedobsessing over back cracking and it changing my body hi my name is james lately i have been dealing with this anxietyocd that prevents me from enjoying myself

i more specifically worry about my health and right now my fixation is on my neckback

it started when i discovered a new way to crack my back where i push my head forward and my shoulders and arms back its a very funny and awkward pose to do but it cracks inside my back

ever since i discovered this way of cracking my back i started doing it often so often to the point where i would make my back sore i would repetitively do it in different ways to try and crack different spots because my brain makes me think i need to crack it fully and evenly so i would repeat it and do it and try and see if it would make a difference

anytime i feel a pain or sensation somewhere in my body i worry if its related to whether i have or havent cracked my back or when i smoke weed sometimes i wont feel as high and ill think its because i cracked my back or because i didnt its super strange and every time i mention it to my friends they wonder why i think their is a connection

i just want to get stoned and watch a movie half the time and then i get flooded with these thoughts that the weed wont work the same because of how ive been cracking my back and sometimes my breathing even feels different so i worry the cracking has affected my lungs hence affecting how i smoke weed

can someone help me out i just want to be able to chill and leave this in the past but ive gotten caught up in a cycle of self checking if things feel the same and cracking my back in different ways to the point where my back gets sore in those areas like when i go into the position i go into to crack my back i can feel the soreness in the muscles is this just from cracking it so much i worry i have damaged my back from doing it

am i still able to smoke weed and chill even if i crack my back like is there no correlation help would be appreciated",1

im crushed i have a lot or triggers  trauma around friends and friendship and i feel so betrayed i spent weeks feeling nauseated and having serious anxiety anytime i had to talk to anyone at work i was basically despondent and let my house and routine slip into survival mode i didnt buy groceries or do laundry or anything for weeks at the same time my boss left me on read for 10 days when i asked if i was going to lose my job because of the complaints luckily i didnt but the anxiety around that uncertainty compounded things 

so heres my question  how do i move past the anxiety i now feel about my workplace i cant tell who in the department dislikes me so i have to assume everybody does 

before this it was a great job lots of training and growth opportunities super flexible great benefits and salary and i thought great coworkers but im so anxious now that ive withdrawn from the group because i cant be myself 

i am going to therapy but i just need more perspectives on the situation and what to do feeling really anxious tonight about going back to work tomorrow

i finally found out after trying so many things my estrogen is low through a blood test

has anyone had this happen

i’m going to try and work with a nutritionist to fix it estrogen hrt actually was really helpful but also made me feel terrible in other ways so i’m going to try and do it naturally

"yep i ruined it recently had an overwhelming day which left me drained feeling like shit for days to the point i could barely speak to my boyfriend and friends it happens once a month i thought ill get over it again but this time shit when south and didnt come back to normal

my boyfriend was worried about me to the point of crying and at the time i wasnt in place to feel sympathetic or anything really so i just plainly texted sorry and moved on i was totally numb and it scared me after that i just felt like a shit partner ive been thinking to sabotage everything end it all its kinda like i already fucked up whats the point to keep going

 i cant find a job after getting comfortable with people i have harder time opening up and expressing my feelings people get overly attached to me for some reason and they almost immediately read that im moody or dont feel well and worry im not sure i can live this life sure i will survive but after having new connections i understand i cant just work myself to death at a random job its either trying a little or running away like i did in the past and roll with it until i cant take it anymore

today i told my boyfriend im not coming over not until i find a job which basically means for a long time i was really dry when messaging despite feeling better or rather neutral he didnt answer after that im pretty sure i made him cry again 
yesterday my friend told me she gained energy to call me and talk things over and help because i was there for her in the past i didnt want to pick up the phone nor could i so i told her i will call later i never did when she tried to call i ignored her again she texted me fine i wont annoy you anymore 

they are insecure they fear abandonment they told me that im not sure if i myself fear abandonment but im not quite secure either i know i hurt them but i feel like they deserve better so i hope they abandon me im falling into this hole again 

i dont want to search for a job  theres no point i couldnt land anything for 2 months now and my mother just told someone over the phone hes sitting for 2 months now i dont know what hes thinking probably waits till hes offered a million dollar salary i guess all the attempts to find a job dont count fuck me i guess 

i never thought i was good for my boyfriend even before dating i wished to be with him but wanted to push him away i wish hed meet someone better i thought i was getting better i hope they stay unconfronting and leave me for good theres no comming back",1

anyways i stutter thats something i noticed that other people with asd do and i usually do it during sensory hours which i would need regardless because ptsd also comes with sensory difficulties

"worried about my bad teeth hello i’m probably not posting this in the right place but i don’t know what to do

i have general anxiety ocd cptsd

i’m 21 years old i was neglected by my parents for a long time i recently moved into a better environment and am learning to take care of myself

i visited the dentist recently and learned although i already knew my teeth were pretty bad that i have multiple cavities and need a tooth extracted after i learned this two days ago it triggered a cptsd flashback for me and it felt like the world was ending i cried really hard and had to have someone help calm me down i felt very ashamed and hopeless i was somewhat able to recover from that feeling and break out of the flashback but i’m still feeling anxious

i’m on government health insurance and thankfully they cover most of the procedures but if i end up needing a root canal or implant i’ll have to pay for it out of pocket i don’t even have a job right now so i can’t pay for it but the longer i wait the worse it will get

i feel so helpless and stressed i’m paranoid about everything now i feel like i can’t eat anything or drink anything but water and i brush after i eat absolutely anything now i’m worried about acid reflux the gaping cavities in my mouth and my diet i got my teeth cleaned today but i’m still worried about it getting worse no one at the dentist office really made me feel like things were going to be ok i really wanted reassurance from professionals but they all seemed to respond the same… saying that i should come back i should brush every day etc which is helpful and true but didn’t help me feel less panicked or hopeless

i’m looking into jobs so i can save up and eventually fix my teeth but in the meantime i can’t stop worrying it’s all i can think about and i’ve never worked a real job before i have an interviewmeeting today with someone about a position at a local supermarket and i feel so nervous

i’m going to meet with my therapist soon to talk about all this but that’s not for about two more weeks

every time i start doing better in my life it feels like something comes to ruin it all i was being more social improving my energy getting out of the house making friends and having a good time with others i felt like i had a good routine was doing things that i love to do like cook and bake and create art and now it feels like everything is falling apart

any reassurance is helpful any tips or advice to stop worrying is helpful any stories about positive teeth experiences are helpful

"i am stresses due to this i ruined my friendship with a close friend because of my selfishness but i cant accept my mistake

actually i am the asshole here but i still feel that it is not completely my fault so what happened is that we both are highschool students aur subjects are  chemistry and mathematics and i have a strange obsession with physics and maths is that i cant see anyone performing better than me at these to subjects i have always been better than him at academics although he scores below average he somehow scored 6070 in half yearly i had helped him by giving him some important formulas after result came we were talking to each other at a callhe said that he scored that much by his own i told him that he should not forget the important formulas that i gave him as there were 23 questions based on that and this is where all things start going downhill we started to have many conflicts but somehow these were resolved and we became friends again but i didnt like his attitude he didnt talk with me like before he used to he was focused at his studies due to which i felt very insecure and out of this insecurity i used to tell my other classmates that he just rote learns everything and always lieswhich is even true  i share everything with him including my personal life issues it was my mistake that i told him about how messed up my family relations are especially with my father today we were having an argument in classroom as he came to know that i was telling others about how he rote learns and lies to everybody that he didnt study and still scored high there were only 2 boys other than me and him he started abusing my family and so did i then he told about my family issue in front of them without hesitation due to which i later became silent as things could have become worse he now threatens me that he would tell everyone else about my family issues so i told him that i wont talk to him i think i might have npd it was my mistake i wanted to controlled him like i unconsciously did i cant accept my fault despite knowing its my fault a part of me believes that there is some of his fault also he shouldnt have acted arrogant i now want to make his life hell but i dont know how and this is a lesson to everyone that we must not share everything even with our closest also this taught me a lesson that a best friend can become your worst enemy please help me i dont know what to do i just want to make his life hell sorry for such a long paragraph",1

"depression just feels numb im chucking this out there just as a fuck it why not type of thing and to try to wrap my head around whats going on with me truth is at 22 im nowhere near where thought id be by now

been battling with depression since was 16 its been a real rollercoaster you know some days im like lets end this but then chicken out weird right cant even tell if its just how im wired or if lifes just been hitting me hard from the getgo but one things for sure ive always had this itch to vanish completely like off to some deserted island or hiding out in the woods like walter white and lm not picky about how it ends quick or slow cause deep down i feel like deserve it living feels like a neverending struggle yet dont feel like deserve to keep going im so numb these days that i catch myself finding dark humour in my suicidal thoughts its messed up i know but its been so long that its just a part of who am now shaping every bit of me

ive gotten so used to these thoughts that theyre like my default setting its like theyve become part of my identity you know and the thought of not feeling this way scares the hell out of me cause its like what else have got no friends no social life just me holed up at home for weeks on end thats been my life for ages now and ive kinda made peace with it its like im scared to lose this messedup part of me that defines who am everything ive done has been with this wanna check out and lm all alone mindset and hitting 23 soon thats a wakeup call in itself as ive always had this thought in the back of my head from young that i wouldnt make it passed 24 

usually ld be bawling my eyes out thinking like this but now nah im just blank empty im craving some sort of release feeling like lm at the end of my rope i feel pathetic like im just stumbling through life with no clue where im headed

i barely feel like a person anymore its been a downward spiral and cant bring myself to open up about it to anyone my familys in the dark about it all and even my girlfriend bless her heart only knows bits and pieces cause its tough to deal with these things when youre long distance and honestly recently i feel like im just a burden on her and she deserves better and honestly i reckon ld just drain her energy if i let it all out i doubt anyone gets how deep these thoughts run opening up to my parents thats a can of worms im not ready to crack open and dont even get me started on seeking professional help thatd slam shut doors ld never get open again graduated uni but job huntings been a bust i thought itd be my ticket out a fresh start but no dice

sleeps been a joke lately barely scraping a few hours a night always tired always on the edge of losing it ijust want some relief man physically entally emotionally spirituallyim just yearning for a way out i used to be all fit and and cheerful surrounded by mates now im just a lonely fat piece of shit and even hitting the gym does bugger all for me nothing brings me joy anymore feels like this is the end of the road for me

sorry for rambling on just needed to let it all out you know

"anxiety attack deterrents for background my depression goes through cycles that seem to be random in length and severity 

while i call the less depressed portion a high cycle usually its a period of time in which i just dont care about anything i eat because i know i have to i work so i can work on trying to improve my life and otherwise dont really do anything outside of absolute necessity 

the low cycles can be as mild as just being the emotional equivalent of a septic tank or as bad as putting things in order to end it all 

i just ended a high cycle and can tell that this low cycle is going to be horrendous this month is always horrible between valentines day my birthday which also happens to be the anniversary of my ex breaking up with me three friends and family members wedding anniversaries i feel compelled to help celebrate and all the associated media products conversations text messages emails and reminders for these events it just gets so overwhelming and every time i turn around i get blindsided by something else 

historically speaking i feel worse and worse and worse as the month goes by and i can tell that this year is going to be just so much worse thinking about it for just a couple of minutes just now triggered a major anxiety attack

what can i do to mitigate the anxiety attacks are there supplements i can take that might help i want to be proactive about it this year instead of reactive since that hasnt worked for the last nine years

therapy isnt really an option at this time as i dont have the extra 2000 annually for it antidepressants mess withy head in bad ways or just dont do anything at all talking with friends and family either doesnt have any effect or will make things worse i already meditate and exercise but neither seems to really impact the frequency or severity of my depression and anxiety i cant afford a pet and even if i could im not sure id be capable of properly taking care of one during even the best of times",1

"tingling left hand and face during morning 33m

so i have been having some mobility issues in my upper back for a while figured i´d try to incorporate more stretches and movements to loosen everything up

a few days ago i borrowed a very stiff foam roller from my mom to do some thoracic extensions after 23 days of this and some self massaging yesterday i woke up with my left hand being somewhat numbtingly during the morning i felt this tingling sensation around my lips as well this persisted well into the afternoon

this morning when i woke up i felt the sensation in my indexmiddle finger at first then i got up and made breakfast and it became more of the left forearm  face around the mouth area shaking it out does nothing

i ofc attribute it to the foam rolling but i have had a similar thing 10 years ago when i was very close to being burnt out  especially around the face area i am currently on vacation just started and not really feeling stressed over anything directly but i had a sudden realization  a few days ago during a family meetup that i have nothing going on during my holiday and that i am more or less completely alone in my daytoday life besides coworkers and occasionally visiting my mother i had a flashback over the last year and that after the vacation everything will just repeat again i dont really hate my job but it often feels pointless its not really stressful but ive found myself being more and more frustrated these last few months the hopefulness about everything i had during my childhood and early 20s is more or less gone

me being a hypochondriac ofc knows about ms and the symptoms etc but the last time i had a major health scare and thought i was having a heart attack it turned out to be just stress  being close to burnout now that i think about it i remember the tinglingnumbness was also tied to my left handarm

 how common is this for anxiety esp it being concentrated to only one hand isnt it usually both if its stressanxiety related
 can these symptoms occur even if you dont feel stressed in your day to day life i rarely feel stressed but more frustrated and now what whats the point
 have you had similar experiences before",1
"a little bit of a vent but also seeking some advice hi all

i am a 34 yo male who has recently been struggling with what seems like a mystery illness that doctors are now pointing at anxiety but i am just not sure where to go from here if you have any thoughts advice or similar stories id really appreciate any input and also im sorry for the long post

starting about 6 months ago i started having instances of something that i actually have trouble describing which is honestly the hardest part it seems to last between 510 seconds and the only thing i really verbalize when it happens is i tell my wife i dont feel good it comes on suddenly out of the blue and it feels like a legitimate medical emergency while it is happening for those seconds out of the blue and i only say that because it isnt like an oh i feel a little off feeling its an oh i have to call 911 right this second whenever it occurs i immediately reach for my cellphone in my pocket to call 911 because it feels like i am going to die lightheadedness struggling to get a breath

when its happening i can feel myself starting to pass out and just feels like something is seriously wrong after a few moments of this occurrence i feel an adrenaline dump from the panic obviouslyt and then i am just left with a racing heart until i calm down a bit and then i basically just go about my day until it happens again the frequency seems extremely random i could get it and then go a week or two without having it and then randomly during a walk itll occur again or sitting in my chair or during anything

because of this i have had an entire battery of tests done through multiple specialists mostly focusing on my heart nothing of any real significance was ever found i did an echo 15 ekgs 3 holter monitors a cardiac mri and a ct angio cardiac mri was done because docs thought they saw something on my echo but it seemed to turn into a nothing burger

anyway what im having trouble dealing with is all reasonable testing is now done theres really nothing else to do my doctor has now told me youre healthy you need to treat your anxiety about this i am 110 aware that i definitely have anxiety around this however the i dont feel good events come at random times when i am not anxious or nervous at all im just living my life doing stuff and bam out of nowhere it happens im just very scared now because this isnt an oh i just feel off some of the time the events when they happen is a this is it feeling and i hate feeling that multiple times a month as well as thinking this is a matter of not if but when soon and i just dont know what to do because if its something medical that was missed i dont really know how to proceed because theyve already done pretty extensive testing i had covid in february but my symptoms seemed to predate covid by a month or so

anyway this is a little bit of a vent but also if you have any thoughts or advice id really appreciate it",1
"the three keys to make your success inevitable as someone who has been a hair puller and skin picker since the age of twelve i know how hard it may seem to stop i know how easy it is to fall into the helplessness these disorders bring into our lives i also know the toll it can take on your mind and emotions when you fail and feel that you can’t stop but can’t is a dirty word it is a choice you make saying you can’t gives this disorder full control of your life and actions but you are the captain of this ship not your disorder you are able to figure anything out to do this first believe you can 

if you keep these following three keys in mind when you work towards stopping your picking and pulling you will find success it will take time commitment and a lot of action with that being said here are the three keys to making your success inevitable

key one you need to be fully committed to stopping  in order to stop picking and pulling you must be completely and utterly committed to doing the required work to do so you have to give 100 of yourself to attain this goal or else it won’t work out anything less than 100 is not good enough and you’ll fall into the gap of failure in which you’ll be stuck it’s that simple if you do fail get up and try again don’t take the failure personally you are trying different things and they won’t always stick right away but if you’re giving it your all you will succeed just keep taking action and moving forward and you’ll get to your destination in perfect timing

key two take committed consistent imperfect action every day to stop if you are not in action you are not committed when you take action it doesn’t have to be perfect it needs to be committed consistent and imperfect because you are a human navigating a human experience of a disorder that is temporarily paralyzing you but if you take steps daily to move out of it you will succeed in perfect timing no one is going to expect perfection from you that’s your own expectation and it’s not realistic even taking small actions is better than nothing so focus on doing doing doing whenever you get the chance it all adds up at the end

key three burn all bridges that can lead you backward you are committed to stopping therefore there is no going back i’d never heard of the phrase “burn the boats” have you if you haven’t it basically means to burn all paths backward in order to move forward remove any possible avenue that involves not stopping as they will never lead you to your goal once you start working towards stopping your picking or pulling there is no going back if you truly want to stop you must fully commit yourself to doing it you simply don’t allow yourself to go back if you fail you start again and move forward no matter what your mind tells you you refuse to take the failure personally and you use it to move you in a different direction for your goal your mind is always going to tell you to do the opposite of whatever action is actually going to propel you forward

remember lovely souls it doesn’t matter how you start what matters is how you finish just get started by taking daily action that is consistent committed and imperfect and don’t look back not even for a second you may have picking and pulling deeply engraved as a habit now but you can reverse it and stop i picked and pulled for nearly thirty years but with full commitment to doing the work to stop i’ve climbed my way out of that hole if you’re ready to stop picking and pulling but need some guidance i’m ready to stand up and guide you you have to be willing to be fully committed to doing the work reach out and we’ll discover ways to move forward let’s do this

in addition i have a radically awesome community with free resources and daily content that will help you to overcome this disorder i also have oneonone coaching options and i’m working on group coaching programs and courses as well you’ll find people who are struggling with hair pulling and skin disorders so you’ll make plenty of connections for the community you can check it out here  everyone is welcome ",1

it wasn’t until 2019 when i took a promotion at work that brought my family a comfortable middle class lifestyle however it was the pressure of this lifestyle that crushed me all i thought about was failing losing what i fought to attain i felt grief from this anxiety the same way i dealt with mourning my brother’s death  i became disassociated and felt a wave of depression that shook me to my core constant thoughts of suicide and a desire to have never been born 

i sought psychiatric help but it wasn’t very helpful ssri’s exacerbated the issue and made me check out of reality more than deal with it i learned that my mental state ebbs and flows four months in fine next two months i am in danger it wasn’t until last may that i completely broke my wife was pregnant but her doctor did not think the fetus was viable recommend an abortion a week went by before my wife got a second opinion which informed us that the pregnancy was viable

while i was ecstatic i felt broken i could not function i planned my suicide for late july the night of i went to my drawer where i kept my medication and all of the pills were missing i just went back to sleep the next morning i told my wife and she got me help 

i was out on fmla for three months got better and returned to work this week i am ending my three month paternity leave and i feel the doom creeping in

not sure what to do anymore

"debilitating nausea when travelling my mom 63 years old experiences severe nauseavomiting everytime she travels she doesnt travel internationally typically different regions around the continental us to visit family every single time she ends up in the hospital for days at a time due to vomiting when this first became an issue about 10 years ago it was discovered that she had a hiatal hernia doctors assumed that it was the primary cause of the vomiting in recent years however er doctors after scoping of course doubt that the severe gastrointestinal issues would be caused by the hernia apparently the hernia is still present but doesnt appear to be too bad her primary doctor and the countless er doctors shes seen over the years are at complete losses

so heres my question she has been diagnosed to anxiety and admittedly is very anxious when traveling she is not on antianxiety meds is it possible that the anxiety could be the culprit somehow im desperately trying to find a link between the traveling and vomiting again these flares last usually about a week and always result in her being admitted to hospital for days at a time so she can get iv gastro cocktails to help with the nausea and morphine for the severe stomach pains

"how i saved myself from the hell of stress and anxiety 

severe stress plagued me since my teenage years a combination of factors fueled the fire loneliness a lack of friends an abusive environment and indirect bullying from classmates these experiences turned me into a withdrawn person with social phobia and stuttering intrusive thoughts about death and illness fueled by the loss of two relatives in a short period further intensified my anxiety



one day the pressure reached a breaking point i started experiencing convulsions and muscle contractions during sleep my pentup emotions tension and anger surfaced at night my immunity weakened and i lost weight desperate for relief i felt doomed yet knew i had to find a way out



for ten years i endured torment and stress yearning for a human connection a hug anything to feel safe with the realization that no one would come to my rescue i knew i had to take action no savior would magically appear i had to be my own savior



despite battling depression and crippling anxiety over everyday things i scoured the internet for solutions i craved a quick fix a savior a listening ear but alas i didnt find it readily however i did find an answer





books on mindfulness relaxation and meditation became my companions though skeptical i decided to give relaxation techniques a chance i focused on deep breathing and physical relaxation initially i could only achieve a brief sense of calm gradually with practice i learned to carry this feeling with me – outdoors in the garden anywhere this proved invaluable in managing my social phobia when faced with physical symptoms like tension heart palpitations and shaky legs i would tell myself let it shake it doesnt bother me i choose to focus on the beauty around me by surrendering to my bodys sensations i gradually convinced it there was no imminent danger





armed with newfound relaxation skills i gathered my courage and started going to the gym even within the confines of my difficult environment i felt a shift – a slow but steady improvement in my life my thought patterns became more positive remarkably i achieved this transformation without a savior a loyal friend or professional help





today after ten years of mental anguish stress and anxiety i can finally experience relaxation and positivity while i still battle some stuttering and social awkwardness i actively work on improving them i use relaxation techniques to calm my tongue and speak slowly slowly but surely im opening up to people and building social skills despite internal resistance



this is a message to everyone you have the strength to overcome challenges just like i did my journey was especially difficult – i fought in complete isolation with no emotional or financial support remember even the most challenging situations can be navigated you are capable of achieving the same or even greater progress than i have",1
"anxious more than ever  hi all

i have been suffering from anxiety since 2018 my trigger is true crime and a particular event that i choose not to name at this moment triggered it so severely to this day it is still my trigger and i continue to deal with anxiety i will say before 2018 i dealt with test anxiety social anxiety and more in 2020 and 2021 i suffered from health anxiety extremely bad due to the pandemic

however between 2021 and 2023 my anxiety was not terrible and at times it was seasonal specifically when i see my trigger it gets awful but eventually i would calm down this year when i saw my trigger i started to take my adhd pills which are a mood stabilizer but i found that instead of helping me with my anxiety it made it worse my anxiety has never been that bad until that point even when it started in 2018 it was terrible but compared to this time it was comparable which it wasnt usually

i am in therapy again and she is helping me deal with my trigger and understand why it is my trigger my last therapist didnt understand why a true crime story would be my trigger and would disregard my worries and feelings about it dont get me wrong i have plenty of issues in my life but this trigger is taking a toll on me and i still to this day have no clue as to why it does but my new therapist is helping me so much and i feel i am progressing i am in no way or shape cured but i think she is helping she did diagnose me with secondary ptsd i will say when she said that i felt crazy because in no way shape or form did this event that happened before i was born should be able to affect me but being part of this community and talking to my therapist helped me realize plenty of people suffer from this as a journalist i am trying to combat such and learn how to do it before i become a reporter i want to stick to covering positive events but at times journalism involves so much more

also my pcp diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder gad and put me on lexapro 10 mg and propranol 10 mg to say things turned for the better would be an understatement i was feeling normal again after dealing with anxiety for a bit and feeling anxious on a regular i felt amazing however i am plus size and with the lexapro i was eating so much during anxiety my appetite decreases significantly and i dont eat much so when i started to eat more with the medication i didnt think much of it when i told my doctor she switched my medication and decided to put me on prozac 20 mg and kept me on propranol i was on lexapro for a month i believe at times i would feel anxious but i would calm myself down after a while

but i am on prozac and have been on it for about two and a half months i can say i felt anxious more at times but i would calm down because medication is not a cure but it does help a lot however last week i saw my trigger and i calmed myself down however for the past few weeks i felt myself becoming more anxious at times out of nowhere and i wasnt thinking of anything this past wednesday i felt anxious and saw my trigger again i was anxious that whole day and the next day i went to my therapist because my anxiety was lingering and would not tame i did everything breathe walk around watch funny stuff and more i just wanted to tell myself i would improve but i didnt so i am now seeing my therapist every week for my trigger and to air out my worries and find out more deeprooted issues

but as for the medication my doctor increased my prozac to 40 mg and since then i have been feeling anxious out of nowhere it seems like the medicine has increased my anxiety and i want to know what has other peoples reactions been my doctor has put me back on lexapro i am sorry this is a mouthful but i wanted to let out my worries and feelings to see if anyone else compares

i hope you all are well thank you so much",1

guanfacine 3mg

yes you read that right im taking 2 ssris and clomipramine together wanna know why social anxiety thats why ever since my ocd started my social anxiety has gotten uncontrollable 

every day i live in this pain not knowing if i will ever be able to talk to people like a normal person ive never desired anything more to just talk to people 

no joke ive had over 15 jobs where i walked out on day 1 because the feeling of knowing that i will never hold a normal conversation and never being able to make friends with my coworkers just sends me into deep depression 

my parents dont know what to do with me im not providing income theyre more worried than anything though 

i dont know what to do anymore therapy just doesnt work for me because of how intense my ocd is if something from therapy does end up working my ocd will try to find a loop hole in the exercise so it stops working for me its so annoying 

please does anyone know of a medicine i could try that can help me has anyone tried ridiculous combos that ended up working please i just want to talk to people like a normal person im tired of this im at my breaking point

"seroquel as addon to lexpro in treatment of anxiety intrusive thoughts ocd  amazing i’ve been prescribed lexapro 40 mg and have been taking it for close to 20 years for ocd recently i’ve started taking seroquel 25 mg at night because i’m currently going through a crisis situation and my intrusive thoughts do not stop they’ve become obsessive 247 and i’ve been on the verge of panic attacks especially in the daytime i just want something to take the edge off f so i can at least function and stop overthinking so much

i just took my first dose of 25 mg of seroquel last night wow my anxiety is so much better it’s almost like my brain starts to want to overthink and obsess and a few seconds later it just dissipates and disappears it’s almost like i don’t care as much about the outcome of the crisis anymore it feels like i’m outside my body to some extent whatever will be will be 

i was prescribed it as twice a day should i take it as such or start with once daily only because my drowsiness was really really high the next day and i’m afraid if i take it twice my drowsiness would be too much is once daily enough if it’s taking care of the job i’ve heard some people take 125 mg twice daily instead of 25 mg twice daily for the drowsiness issue but i’m still worried i’ll be too groggy the next day 

also does the drowsiness dissipate over time am i able to drive while on this i mean i feel drowsy so i probably shouldn’t until i find a solution to the drowsiness",1

"im so frustrated  tw sorry this is gonna be a lot tw for medical anxiety

im 19 and ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety recently its gotten so bad ive actively been trying to overcome my fear of doctors to try and see if there is actually something wrong with me the problem is i live with my brother hes my legal guardian 39 and he wont listen to me ive been telling him for a while i want help it started as seeing a therapist again i stopped going my last year of highschool and he was going to start seeing one too so he said he would look into some that took our insurance that was over a month ago and he still hasnt set anything up 

then my anxiety and paranoia started getting so bad i started thinking about getting back on medications they didnt work for me when i was younger but im more open to trying new things now especially with how bad its gotten

finally a few weeks ago my panic attacks started giving me chest pain they always did this but now the chest pain lingers ive always been afraid of heart attackscancer anything you name it really so i knew it was my anxiety manifesting as that and that helped for a while but now the pain comes with just a few anxious thoughts and it stays all day i take walks listen to music read books take hot baths ive tried everything and while they give me temporary relief its never enough 
im so tired of living like this always worried and uncomfortable because it feels like theres someone sitting on my chest and making my whole body numb 

i tell him multiple times a day i want to go to the doctor i ask him to help me schedule appointments because i cant drive and only he knows his work schedule but he never actually helps and recently he told me he lost my insurance card which he said he would hold on to even though i asked for it 
i know this seems really pathetic but i dont know how to do this all alone i was medically neglected a lot as a child by my mom and so my fear of doctors only got worse 

im just really afraid and not sure what to do because i feel like im dying every day and i feel helpless i have no form of transportation and i dont even know what doctors offices i could call and make appointments at since i can no longer go to childrens its all so much to try and work through alone and ive never done this before 

he does this even for physical pain i experience that isnt anxiety related so its not like he doesnt believe me he just wont put in the effort to help me at all when it comes to this he also does this with our animals refusing to take them to the vet until its been almost too late one of our cats almost died from an infection in her eye because he wouldnt take her until days of me pleading and hes not a bad person so i dont know why he does this i just know we cant afford an ambulance visit so im convinced im going to die here without knowing whats wrong with me ",1

physical exercise and running  i started running again because my anxiety has been acting up something about running and putting strain on my heart balances out the sensation of anxiety i feel so good after a run and ride the waves of endorphins throughout the day i’m just writing this to remind myself that anxiety is work and i have to do the work of exercise eating right and being positive otherwise no medication will help so now i will run as often as i can even when i’m feeling good because that’s when i’m most vulnerable to a breakdown,1
"i always fear the worst from a financial standpoint i did not grow up poor my family has lived a comfortable middleclass life but for some reason i always am anxious about my financial future

 i have a solid paying job for now
 i have a solid amount of savings for now

the solid amount of savings is for a down payment on a property i would be a firsttime home buyer but i am petrified of fucking up if i lose my job at any point i have doubts that i’ll make this pay or higher not because i make a ton but because i have no faith in my ability to interview well 

something i am also worried about one day is if i own a property with a spouse i already assume that i will eventually break up with that person or get divorced and i fear any investment i make with them could lead to my financial demise even with a prenup

"mental health struggle and anxiety hello my apologies for the vague title this is my first post on reddit and i will try to capture my issue as clearly as possible

background

over the past few months i have been really struggling with my mental health in many different ways i am relatively young 26m but this is the first time i am really having to confront my mh

i have recently developed this issue where every beautiful woman i see in the street or work etc is etched into my brain it is like i am entering into this strange state of hyperfixation and no matter how hard i fight my brain i cannot get rid of the image of the women i see

now to be clear i do not see these women as sexual objects nor do i imagine anything sexual the best way i can describe it is like seeing a beautiful painting and you cannot remove it from your brain you keep replaying the painting in your brain to a point where it becomes exhausting note i do not stare but i do glance and sometimes i am noticed and i feel like a scumbag male this also causes a lot of anxiety for me because it impacts my sense of peace 

for note i have had issues with porn in the past as well as some other issues when i was younger but i am trying to quit porn as i slowly move towards christianity i am also trying to take active steps like not even looking at women as i do not want to disturb their day

biggest concern

i am worried that this issue could leach or leak into my future romantic relationship i want to be satisfied with one piece of art forever without the need to constantly look at others i have been in one serious relationship where this was an issue for me and i tried to talk about it with my partner but she did not understand my struggle

any advice would be appreciated",1

"anxietypanic attacks every day on my dream vacation hi all i hope this is the right sub to post about this ive been having anxietypanic attacks my whole life but have gained a lot of control over them over the past few years i booked a trip to the uk with my husband almost a year ago weve been talking about how excited we are for this trip every day leading up put a ton of money into it and now were here

first day was great  i took an ativan before the flight had little to no anxiety landed then had a great first day that night i get some ibs symptoms and suddenly feel insanely overwhelmed by how far away i am from home take another ativan wake up take a stressful 4 trains to our next destination another ativan because i can feel myself losing my grip on reality on the last train arrived and tried to go out to explore had to immediately go back to the hotel because i could feel a panic attack starting 

now end of day 3 im still having ibs symptoms i took another ativan in the morning and forced myself to eat some toast was able to explore a little and take our next train to scotland pushed through the abdominal stuff and had a great day now its night time and im panicking again the whole 9 yards nausea shaking blurry vision etc and im so confused because i had a great exciting day 

aside from the total physical discomfort im afraid of ruining this experience for my husband hes been more excited than me for this trip and i dont want him to feel like he has to worry about me the whole time i just have no clue what to do im scared my belly hurts and i want nothing more than to have a good time i cant help but feel frustrated and resentful toward my brainbody for doing this to me without my permission  i know its just a physiological reaction thats trying to keep me safe but it feels violating nonetheless  

any help is appreciated

has anyone tried buspar after other medications not working or making you feel worse  i’ve tried 4 antidepressants vraylar and hydroxyzine the latter did nothing while the other 5 made me feel worse my psychiatrist is an idiot i’m waiting to see a different psychiatrist so i consulted my great aunt who’s a retired psychiatrist and she recommended buspar ,1
does social anxiety make you passive i suffer from severe social anxiety and mildmoderate depression i typically will get my nails done at the same place about once a month and today i went to get gel polish and acrylic removed just to give my nails a break and i felt like i was overcharged because i paid around the same amount i would for a usual refill i didn’t question it at check out and complained to myself in the car wondering whether or not i really was overcharged i pretty much just brushed it off but i don’t understand why i didn’t just ask i guess i was worried about being embarrassed stuff like this makes me feel abnormal because anyone else would have asked,1
"more anxious then ever  hi all 

i have been suffering from anxiety since 2018 my trigger is true crime and a particular event that i choose not to name at this moment triggered it so severely to this day it is still my trigger and i continue to deal with anxiety i will say before 2018 i dealt with test anxiety social anxiety and more in 2020 and 2021 i suffered from health anxiety extremely bad due to the pandemic 

  
however between 2021 and 2023 my anxiety was not terrible and at times it was seasonal specifically when i see my trigger it gets awful but eventually i would calm down this year when i saw my trigger i started to take my adhd pills which are a mood stabilizer but i found that instead of helping me with my anxiety it made it worse my anxiety has never been that bad until that point even when it started in 2018 it was terrible but compared to this time it was comparable which it wasnt usually 

  
i am in therapy again and she is helping me deal with my trigger and understand why it is my trigger my last therapist didnt understand why a true crime story would be my trigger and would disregard my worries and feelings about it dont get me wrong i have plenty of issues in my life but this trigger is taking a toll on me and i still to this day have no clue as to why it does but my new therapist is helping me so much and i feel i am progressing i am in no way or shape cured but i think she is helping she did diagnose me with secondary ptsd i will say when she said that i felt crazy because in no way shape or form did this event that happened before i was born should be able to affect me but being part of this community and talking to my therapist helped me realize plenty of people suffer from this as a journalist i am trying to combat such and learn how to do it before i become a reporter i want to stick to covering positive events but at times journalism involves so much more 

  
also my pcp diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder gad and put me on lexapro 10 mg and propranol 10 mg to say things turned for the better would be an understatement i was feeling normal again after dealing with anxiety for a bit and feeling anxious on a regular i felt amazing however i am plus size and with the lexapro i was eating so much during anxiety my appetite decreases significantly and i dont eat much so when i started to eat more with the medication i didnt think much of it when i told my doctor she switched my medication and decided to put me on prozac 20 mg and kept me on propranol i was on lexapro for a month i believe at times i would feel anxious but i would calm myself down after a while 

  
but i am on prozac and have been on it for about two and a half months i can say i felt anxious more at times but i would calm down because medication is not a cure but it does help a lot however last week i saw my trigger and i calmed myself down however for the past few weeks i felt myself becoming more anxious at times out of nowhere and i wasnt thinking of anything this past wednesday i felt anxious and saw my trigger again i was anxious that whole day and the next day i went to my therapist because my anxiety was lingering and would not tame i did everything breathe walk around watch funny stuff and more i just wanted to tell myself i would improve but i didnt so i am now seeing my therapist every week for my trigger and to air out my worries and find out more deeprooted issues  

but as for the medication my doctor increased my prozac to 40 mg and since then i have been feeling anxious out of nowhere it seems like the medicine has increased my anxiety and i want to know what has other peoples reactions been my doctor might put me back on lexapro i am sorry this is a mouthful but i wanted to let out my worries and feelings to see if anyone else compares 

i hope you all are well thank you so much ",1

"i’m in the same state all the time and don’t feel any emotions  is this dissociation 
i went through a very stressful and traumatic time last summer which made me develop insomnia and anxiety and i wasn’t able to sleep for 3 weeks 
 ever since i’ve not experienced my feelings and emotions at all and i’m afraid this is due to dissociation for the past 9 months i have not felt tired hungry or full and i also no longer feel the effect of alcohol i’m on anti depressants and anti psychotics but i’m not sure if it’s helping at all because i just feel like i’m stuck in the same state all the time it’s really the most horrible feeling and i feel like nothing can make me feel any different and i just feel so empty i also have a loop of a song constantly stuck in my head 247 

i wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and what you did to address them would tms work at this point i’m desperate to try anything as i just want to feel better and i’m not sure how much longer i can go feeling like this",1

anyways this one woman whom ive spoken to many times was asking me some questions that concerned me she asked where i worked and i told her the name and then she asked what city it was in 

this struck me as odd i work at a coffee shop chain and for some reason she asked what city i work in why would she care to ask what city i work in it concerned me i also told her that when i was about to be hired i delayed and pushed them away for a week or so now im worried she might call up my work or something and tell them

i should also say at this moment my depression and anxiety is terrible and my parents are helping me a lot at this moment

"it was a bad idea and now i am even worse for it hey everyone

i have been dealing with anxiety for months now and it has been hell frequent panic attacks headaches formication feeling like insects are crawling in on or underneath your skin etc what annoy me the most are the changing symptoms and the sense of impending doom i have had health anxiety and countless times and thought that i was having a stroke brain tumor heart attack parkinsons aneurysm i even thought i had a worm in my brain at some point each time i came to this subreddit and reading peoples experiences helped me relax

i 21m am super broke and i cant even afford the tests let alone consultation medication or therapy so a lot of what i know i gathered from online sources and this community the past 3 years ive been self studying intensely no social life no friends no break and piling a lot of pressure on myself to get us out of this situation which i think is the source of my anxiety it forced me to change my plans to get a job quickly and get medical attention but i feel worse each day and dont know for how much longer

i had been feeling better for a few week prior to last weekend apart from the few headaches here and there nothing i couldnt handle i had quit alcohol and marijuana when the anxieties began but had the genius idea to try weed again i thought it wouldnt be a problem since weed always made me relax before weed is really cheap here the equivalent of about 030 so i decided to use it as kind of a substitute for antidepressants boy was it a bad idea

for hours my heart rate was through the roof i couldnt relax at all had a hard time walking racing thoughts etc it was the worst night of my life no exaggeration i even kept praying promising never to do it again once it passes and now i fully intend to keep that promise

the worst thing is it may have reversed all the positives i had made ive felt at my worst since that day i have intense pain in certain parts of my head the location changes frequently dizziness often losing balance when walking tightness in my throat ive had several episodes which felt like panic attacks but my heart rate did not rise i feel really weak trembling and struggling to keep myself upright i have felt slight vibration in different parts of my body ringing in my ears that went on for way longer than others i have had before as i write this i am frustrated because i cant even work anymore",1

i dont have crazy panic attacks anymore at night and to age of 23 i have medication to help but somewhere in between that time its felt like ive just become dumber and dumber and now im having a hard time keeping track of things and pausing my words and i used to stutter but thats gotten better

dae suppress anxiety all day leading to anxiety attacks middle of the night   i’ve noticed in the middle of the night more frequently i’ll randomly jolt awake head burning and tingling heart feels like it’s racing but usually it’s not and i’ll be gagging trying to catch my breath and that head feeling is the first thing that tells me this is one of my little anxiety episodes i have constant anxiety all day and attempt to suppress a lot of ocd compulsions as well and it’s like it all falls apart at night i take my luvox at 1030 and fall sleep before midnight but somewhere between 35 i’ll wake up in a panic but not quite a panic attack it’s like im suppressing that too it’s like im aware im panicking but won’t let myself have the full attack my body somehow keeps my actual heart rate low even if it feels like it’s beating hard or fast and it automatically tries to regulate my breathing but ill still be feeling like im about to freak out or throw up or both also terrified of throwing up but worked through some therapy to be able to talk and say it but i was just wondering does anyone else do this suppress all day then wake up panicking at night or even suppressing that as well like it sounds bad to say but sometimes i feel like i just need the full attack cause there’s so much pent up energy and emotions but it’s like my body won’t let me,1
"dealing with irrational thoughts i feel like i need to talk to someone about this in the last few years i have for some reason developed a fear that concert tickets that i have paid for through legitimate means will be declined at the door i know so random this came out of nowhere as i have never had a bad experience with this my brain just decides to prepare for the worst and fully accepts that the universe is going to try and stop me from attending a show i think it might be because i get so excited about it that i need to prepare for disappointment just in case does this happen to anyone else 

another thing is i get paranoid that i have inputted the wrong information in forms and so will be declined or flagged for identity fraud when i can literally see that i’ve entered the correct information 

fyi i have not been diagnosed with any mental health disorders but pretty sure something is up because of these thoughts and also i’ve been picking my skin compulsively for over 10 years whenever i try to bring up these things with family they tell me to just stop and get over it 

anyways if anyone experiences similar things please let me know any advice to cope with irrational thoughts would be much appreciated

"is this because of anxiety will i be better happy if i took anti anxiety pills when i21m was in my childhoodin 6th grade i used to perform in school morning assembly school dramas my parents were very strict about my studies and used to very angry on my bad marks and stuff i didnt interact that much in class unless the teacher had specifically asked me something though i had some friends my parents didnt teach me how to ride a bike or didnt even buy me one all the focus was on my academics till the 10th grade atleast   
then i changed schools in my 7th grade and in the new school i was really nervous  and i didnt participate in any thing nor played sports i would always think how bad i would be if i played football or cricket and how all the other students would laugh at me i didnt even play any musical instruments so basically you get it i just went to school to study and seeing all the other students playing with each other having lunch together just made me more lonely though i tried to hide it i still do it by making it seem like it didnt bother mebut it did   
whenever i talk to people or even my friends  i start sweating a lot in my armpits is it because of anxiety even while giving a college interview i started sweating at my armpitswhenever i think about stuff like going out partying or doing something social i would start to sweat at my armpits and sometimes if it hot sweat on my head as well but i wasnt like this when i used to perform in drama before 6th grade i shake my legs side by side even while writing this i am shaking both of my legsi am really afraid of people judging me and like going out to places especially if i have never been to those places i am kind of scared of doing anything by myself without the help of someone especially if that task is going outside and doing something i want to learn riding bike but think of other kids in the locality who are doing the same and what would they and their parents think when they would see me failing at riding a bike",1

"my little kid needs help hi everyone i hope i can get some help here
i take care of a 9 year old boy
and he started to have some tics early this year
first in his arms and shoulders 
now they are also in his head and neck

when they started his mom brought him to the hospital and they said it was anxiety and maybe a secondary effect of some medicine that he had before so they didn’t do anything 

he has been “fine” all this months still with his tics but last night he woke up crying of pain in his neck we imagine is because of the constant shaking of neck and head from the tics and he has been feeling miserable 

i am just his caregiver i can’t control the background of his family i think part of the anxiety is because the divorce of his parents and all the changes that have come since then 

i’m asking desperately please how can i help him cope with that anxiety and more exactly with the tics how can he liberate himself from that tension and stress in a different way that is not shaking his neck and head and arms so he doesn’t have to be in pain
any skills exercises anything 
please 

thank you ",1
"anyone has health anxiety how to cope my dad has suffered a stroke 2 years ago and as someone with anxiety prior to that the incident has escalated my anxiety to the point whereby i became super health conscious and paranoid whenever any similar symptoms were present eg stiff neck headache numbness my dad had a very rare case of brain stroke called davf i was really paranoid that it might be passed down but the doctor has reassured that it is typically not genetics 

despite the reassurance i can’t help but get super paranoid with my body sometimes to the point whereby i can’t breathe and i felt like i’m going to pass out even though i am still young in my 20s i go for super thorough health screening regularly once a year and tried all sorts of mindwellness activities like yoga to help me with my anxiety

anyone shares similar experiences maybe we can talk about it and help each other",1

"going back into a trade… so basically i’m working at a grocery store right now but before this i was doing hvac yep a little over year ago i was climbing under houses going into attics and cutting my skin everyday for 19 an hour 

well… i’m doing it again 

i don’t want to there are just no other decent paying jobs around me so it’s my only option really to be honest though everything i mentioned above is not what i disliked about a trade it’s the learning the stress of slowing down the team the stress of fucking up someone’s house and the constant dread of having to worry about everything again the next day 

i was let go from hvac because it was winter and business slowed down so really i’m left here now stressing on if i’ll be good enough or fast enough

any mental advice would be greatly appreciated

"how to open yourself up to spiritual experiences nonphysical encounters synchronicities manifestation and not block yourself from them this all depends on how you feel and especially the actions that raise up your selfesteem on a daily basis  


  
what are emotions emotions are energy in motion a strong release ofdrawing in of energy intofrom the universe   


  
so how can we use them for our benefits  


  
the most important thing to know is that your emotion matters because they are always attracting things to you that match your emotional output and similar to a radio frequency you cannot hear the fm station if you are tuned into the am station  


  
for example over the years ive had encounters from angels and nonphysical beings who explained to me that they had been trying to contact me for a while but couldnt even reach me because of my low vibrationnegative emotions at that time  


  
this showed to me how important our emotional output is if we desire to be in a position to receive anything from the events of the universe put in motion that comes from a higher vibrational side  


  
one thing to consider is how we can feel an impressive euphoric energy at will through the activation of our spiritual energy it is that energy that is most easily felt with goosebumps from positive situationsstimuli  


  
keep in mind though that goosebumps should only be used as a checkpoint to understandexperience this euphoric energy and that this energy can be learned to be brought up without the goosebumps leaving us in control of this blissfully wave  


  
this energy has been acknowledged in many cultures and documented under many names like bioelectricity life force prana chi qi orgone rapture tension aura euphoria ecstasy mana vayus asmr nen intent tummo odic force kriyas pitī frisson ruah spiritual energy secret fire the tingles ondemand quickening voluntary piloerection aether chills spiritual chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help  


  
if you understand how important it is to be able to bring this positive energy up whenever you need to here are three written tutorials this euphoric energy   


  
ps everyone feels it at certain points in their life some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on those are exactly the people you can find on rspiritualchills where they share experiences knowledge and tips on it",1

"cardiac anxiety i have dealing with moderate to severe health anxiety over the past 4 months my symptoms have included panic attacks constipation heart palpitations and chest pain the first visit to the hospital i was misdiagnosed with prolonged qtc the machine said 596 but when it was recalculated by hand days later the same physician said it was a mistake and my qtc only 431 using bazett’s formula 

i proceeded to do a 15 day holter monitor which revealed no arrhythmia’s a pvc burden of 01 and a pac burden of 025 my echocardiogram revealed i have zero structural concerns no enlargement or any congenital issues i then began taking lexapro which seemingly enhanced my cardiac symptoms heart palpitations chest pain i visited the hospital two more times with no abnormal findings in ecg’s chest xray’s etc i have since stopped taking lexapro and am looking to treat my anxiety through dietlifestyle 

my questions is would a low carbohydrate diet be ideal for a person dealing with the issues i have i have been eating that way for a week or so and feel great but i want to be careful to not provoke any cardiac issues in the future which is now the driver of my health anxiety likely triggered by the misdiagnosis from the doctor thoughts",1

"sick of feeling anxious because there’s ongoing tension in my family my wife 31 and i 27 have been together since early 2021 ive always been close with my family especially my brother 29 initially my wife got along well with my family including my brother however since my brother got engaged to his current fiancée whom he dated in college things have changed

my brothers personality has shifted and he now behaves in ways he once criticized his fiancée is nice but our conversations remain surfacelevel and despite my efforts they seem uninterested in becoming closer theyve made some questionable decisions like befriending my high school bully who is now a bridesmaid in their wedding they also borrowed a large sum of money from my parents which led to a major argument where my brother was ungrateful and hurtful resulting in a strained relationship

since then my wife has developed a strong aversion to my brother expressing extreme negative feelings about him she doesnt want him near our future children accusing him of misogyny and racism and even calling him a nonce and saying she wouldn’t want out future children near him she has even suggested we move away from my parents though we prefer staying due to the good schools and childcare in our area

im torn because family events now cause significant anxiety my wife has reluctantly agreed to attend my brother’s wedding but refuses to go to any other celebrations leaving me to handle my parents expectations alone i’ve started counseling because i’m tired and so anxious of peoplepleasing and walking on eggshells

i know my relationship with my brother will never be the same but i still want to maintain some level of contact for family harmony my wife however is adamant about cutting ties with plans to start a family i’m scared and unsure whose advice to follow

any advice on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated",1

does anxiety does this to your brain like there’s this thing that stresses me even tho it’s impossible to happen but things around me or things i watch seems to relate to that thing that stresses me like it catches my attention like it’s a sign that this thing that stresses me out is real

is this just my anxiety talking like things that relates to the thing that stresses me out is all over me even tho i don’t seek it

"need help waited too long to ask out crush and feel like i’m stuck in the past 


so around the end of the school year this girl started sitting by me and was really nice to me by the things she did i kinda picked up that she was into me and got a big crush on her looked forward to every class but was too scared to ask her out on the last day of class i had a great opportunity but i chickened out i saw her on the last test day but again got way too scared this was over a month ago all summer i have been stressing about this and it’s been ruining my mental health since the last day me and hee used to snap every day twice i would get left on delivered for 3 days but since the 3rd of july i have been on delivered now i knew she was leaving for a vacation and got back the 4th so i waited until then to start going to the mall she works at a store there and if i saw her we could catch up and i would ask her out this didn’t happen and i just decided to break the ice by sending her a text relating to something we talked about in art she responded like super bubbly and funny just like she was talking to me in class i sent a text saying i was going mini golfing tuesday and said do you wanna come with to her she said she’s going out of town monday but to have fun i responded with “okay u too maybe some other time” and for 2 days have been on delivered 

i keep thinking about the last three weeks of school when we would talk i just wish i did something different i would relive the last 8 months of my life just so i could get back to late mayearly june and do something different i’ve never had a girl act like that to me and enjoyed it so much i was awkward almost all of the time but i just can’t get over our time together i had hyped myself up so much to ask her out but ruined it even if i asked her online within the 1st week of summer it probably would have gone better i had enjoyed seeing her in clsss so much and obsessed over it during the end of school i didn’t get to enjoy it like i normally would rather obsessing over if she liked me or not i don’t know if i fumbled really really badly or she just never liked me i romanticize everything that happened around that time but now it’s all attached to memories of her like when i listened to one of my favorite albums i first heard it around that time i always think about her i just wish i wasn’t scared school ended 5 weeks ago and since then i have just been stressing wasting away wishing me and her could go do fun activities but no i was too scared and lost my only opportunity and wasted all this time i’m on the verge of tears typing this i’m sorry for the rant i just need help and don’t know what to do thank you",1
"will alprazolam interject with my verbalmnemonic performance call it 

please read the last paragraph if you want to get to the point

i might use xanax and alprazolam intercheangebly and i dont know if thats correct anyway im not promoting medical treatement as a quick fix despite it being my primary for of therapy as for this moment in time i had a really small amount prescribed only after a pretty impactful event in my life even if in retrospect it  was kind of silly and since then ive really used it more seldomly than i should have even more seldomly than the wreck that gabapentin was for my temper even if i suffer relentlessly of heart palpitations and anxiety attacks it was for true emergencies for the most part

out of fear ive never used xan before tests i have a problem with translating thoughts into spoken language  that frankly i should have assested  and overall recalling things to my mind that would be otherwise obvious to others but i think thats part of the spectrum of problems that come with anxiety needless to say i do poorly in oral tests if im not exactly sure of were my thoughts are gonna lead funny part about the italian final colloquium as part of graduation is that you dont know the subject of your speech until it is handed to you already im off the rails with the endless arguments that jam my thinky part and worst case scenario i cant form a single coeherent phrase in front of the commission what do

  
i know xan has made me kind of wonky before but i took half of one 50 mg and i dont feel mentally altered if anything im sleepy as a normal person would at 3 am but enough about me did medication help you through stage fright and like more importantly what is your mindset during an important interview i think  as a master strategist myself  im gonna try set the mood for something more friendly and maybe i might get a subject that wont be a pain in the rear to break into smaller circumstantial topics",1

struggling to enjoy life since finishing chemotherapy hello everyone i’ve been struggling with this for awhile and need some advice i’m currently 25 and i’ve struggled with my mental health for most of the last decade i’m definitely not at my lowest point as that was in 2021 when i attempted suicide however things are still far from ideal i got diagnosed with cancer in mid 2022 and i finished chemotherapy a few months ago around when i finished chemo i was told that there is around a 75 chance my cancer will return i’m not going through chemo again so if it does return it’s not looking good for me since hearing this news i haven’t been able to get it out of my head i truly don’t know what to do i’ve talked to my therapist about this a few times and we’ve yet to come up with anything that helps me deal with this i write about it i talk to my friends and family about it i cry about it but no matter what every single fucking night when i lay down to sleep it’s all i can think about i’ve entirely lost myself i’m starting to hate the things i once loved and i’m losing hope that i’ll ever become the best version of myself,1
"stress  rant just too much of it hi i am not sure if this is the right place for the upcoming rant  other subreddits are removing my post idk why fr  and i am really sorry for not being articulate like other posts or for offending anybody here  please understand i am feeling suicidal please have sympathy  but i am just going to say it i hate web development so much for so many reasons

every time i touch anything webrelated front it is or back i just freak out like i just got bitten by a poisonous snake or something

there are many reasons for that mainly because in some way it fuels my psychological problems i was always angry depressed with myself now the situation is i am 10x angry and depressed and i yell in everybodys face when they come smiling at me

i feel extreme hatred towards people better than me i say no to every opportunity i stopped taking care of myself and i dont watch youtube anymore because of the many stupid videos i get recommended everyday about tech trends and sit

first i have to say my hatred against web dev is mainly because many things to learn much to expect from me i only know mern because i made some small authentication system alongside with my 1 year working as a professional for 2 companies but god knows why noone wants to hire me and even if someone wants to they expect me to run everything by myself and fking google no one wants to help and now that i have 1 year of professional experience everyone expects me to write my own full stack app in under 1 month with no issues

recently 2 friends of mine and i started creating an app for parents to keep track of their children which consists of

dashboard page  with authentication and all that  using reactjs for school

the app itself for parents  consists of roughly 10 pages  using flutter

server which handles both things above

along with a notification system indicating when each child is left when bus starts its shift both for school and parents frontends

only i know how everything works but both of them know nothing and they are learning on the go which irritates me

well for many this project in theory is simple my inexperienced friends are also saying it is simple and they are saying im the lazy one here like they are expecting so much of me for some reason

we are making compromises and halfmeasures on the way to make that app work for the money but man i am freaking out like crazy and i dont know why i spent the last 3 entire night shivering uncontrollably this is not the only time this happens

i was working for a latvian company  my first job ever  as a junior phpreact full stack dev

they were specializing in magento ecommerce websites development i had no idea what even magento is when i started i tried genuinely to learn the technology because i was supposed to be in one of the teams working for clients i learned a bit but it was not enough

i spent the remaining time of me working there stressing the sit out of myself because i was slow mentors and seniors had no time for me and clients were understandably angry because some of the tasks were maintenance on the production site

working on side projects is also one of my nightmares like for goodness sake i care less about a todo list or an ecommerce clone or that i may can do it but dont want to do it i work on side projects sometimes but i leave them unfinished for lack of ideas and lack of interest

i really dont know if you  the reader  understand anything from what i wrote above so sorry for that i cant think straight these days but man screw this i am going to find someone else to have my role in that stupid bustracking app for my friends and i am leaving web dev for good i need to rethink my life choices i cant remember a time in the last 3 years when i was genuinely happy i am so depressed i cant even cry if i wanted to and im 23 what a stupid way to start my life with",1

"coffee gives me anxiety  hey everyone 

i’m writing to see if it’s related or what could cause so much anxiety 

whenever i drink coffee even decaf i get really anxiousnervous it’s like my jaw clench a little and i feel weird as if my body is in hyper vigilance and anxiety it’s odd i thought it was because of my stressful job but even if i drink a coffee when i’m chilling at home then i feel this way 

i like the way coffee tastes but i’m not drinking it for the caffeine it doesn’t have any wakening effect on me that’s why i drink decaf  just for the taste of it

maybe it’s bigger than just caffeine

"the prospect of getting better i have been struggling with a depressive disorder and ocd tendencies for years now and i dont even remember or relate to who i was before it all got so bad my ocd tendencies are still not great but i recently got on a new medication for my depression and for the first time i feel like i can do stuff not just motivation wise im actually looking forward to the future for once 

also the things everyone kept telling me to do so i would stop being depressed exercise basic hygeine sleep actually help now whereas in the past exercising or showering would take up most of my energy for the day idk i hate to be the person who says it gets better because it doesnt feel it when youre bad you feel like youre going insane at least i did and the idea that something can help seems so distant orand misleading it does get better but it takes time and most of the time a lot more money yay capitalism murica and all that than people can afford to spend and getting better also involves getting worse sometimes too because its not linear especially when you if youre like me have an attachment to your depressed self so you dont want to get better 

honestly ill probably hit a low again depression first got bad in 2020 ill let you guess why then steadily got manageable then got bad again after i broke up with my gf last year because bad stuff hapoens and we have to tough it out or we can just give up and die but then all the effort already put into surviving seems pointless honestly that idea was the thing that kept me alive 

when youre depressed everyday is a fight for survival against nothing but yourself ans the idea that i spent everyday fighting for something just to give up on it made me keep pushing for a goal i couldnt see but i can see it now and im finally ok with getting better i finally can think beyond doing whatever i can to get through the day

could ssris help me  hey guys ive been having a really rough time recently for some background i struggled with anxiety from a young age and i first went to therapy in 2021 where i was diagnosed with depression and panic disorder and i had high scores for ocd anxiety paranoia and hipochondria with that i was prescribed paxil 10 mg a day and took it for 6 months and it helped with nothing at all the psychiatrist didnt want to make my dose bigger or let me switch meds so i just stopped i have had horrible anxiety since the beggining of this year and have started seeing a new therapist seeing her for 6 months now we have been doing breathwork and positive thinking therapy but it really isnt helping she has recommended me pills not sure if its things like benzos or ssris didnt want to take them so i just declined every time she mentioned pills and now i have seriously started thinking about it i am in a constant state of panic and have started getting regular panic attacks the thoughts i have are that i feel like i am going crazy or eventually will and i feel like i dont know what is normal everything sets me off and its horrible i cant distract myself i bought some plant based calming pills and i take them now every time i panic but i dont know if they do much because my thoughts are still the same i am afraid that i will forever be in this thought loop  i am really sad about it because my life is normal and i have no issues with people in my life or my life situation over all if it matters i am 22 f can someone give me advice if this was your mindset before and you managed to overcome it because i feel so helpless and i hate talking about this because it makes the issue more real and if someone can explain to me until i have my next therapy session in a little bit over a week how would ssris work do they make your body calm or do they make your mindset better as well again the ones i was on really didnt do anything apart from give me brain zaps as withdrawl i hope someone will respond i dont think my state of mind has ever been this bad  ,1

"feeling dizzy while standing or sitting in crowded places  hi

  
i’ve often felt an unsettling sensation as if im losing my footing particularly in crowded places though it doesnt always happen this feeling also arises when im conversing with people im not very familiar with

what happens is

 my breathing becomes shallow and rapid
 occasionally i experience brief moments where it feels like im about to lose consciousness—everything momentarily goes dark although i dont actually faint its similar to a sudden jolt in the brain
 if i stand still the feeling that i might fall overwhelms me prompting me to shift my feet in search of stability however the ground beneath feels unsteady as if an earthquake is occurring making it difficult to find balance
 theres a noticeable pressure in my eyes as if theyre struggling to handle the situation

i am uncertain if the dizziness is part of the shallow breathing which is caused by anxiety or if its the eyes or even the ears

when im around others i experience a peculiar sensation in my mind although i rationally understand that people are likely not paying much attention to me i cant shake the subconscious feeling that they are staring and judging this often triggers a sense of panic

for instance i might be sitting in a public space feeling as though everyone around me is watching me this sensation can make me feel unsteady even when im securely seated

does anyone else feel this way for me the most challenging part is the dizziness it feels as if i might fall at any moment which adds a sense of instability to my life it’s like battling a constant weakness im striving to be strong but this issue is a significant obstacle for me

"how to stop being influenced by the opinion of others hey you guys
i would really appreciate some advice for the following

i have a history of bullying and being rejected by the people around me when i grew up i was very well socialized had lots of friends and was very outgoing and i think i had lots of self worth
i danced and had various performances and i also sang and was very comfortable with being the point of attention 
when i was about 9 my life took a very bad turn my dad un4liv3d himself and shortly after that we moved to a whole new place around 250miles away from where we lived
that was the kickstart of me getting bullied lots of kids made fun of me they even once threw stones and so on and so forth with time i changed a lot i got depressed and was not at all the happy kid i used to be but of course my core personality somehow always lived on inside of me i just learned how to hide it and tried to fit in never really did up until graduation i havent had many friends nor was i popular in any way rather the opposite
after i graduated i fell into a very dark hole and it took me about two years to get out of there but since then mental disorders overtook my life ive fought anorexia and i am still in therapy and have learned a lot i am also dealing with ocd

after graduation and with all the history of mental health and therapy and everything i really could find myself again i was able to get more and more comfortable with being me and finally found the right people that really want the best for me and appreciate how and who i am so i really gained lots of confidence back over the past 9 years
but for the past months i am noticing that i am still extremely influenced by the opinion of others and thats the point its not that its the opinion of strangers but rather the opinion of people i love like family and friends or working buddies i really like
whatever a stranger thinks of me doesnt bother me at all 
but i am so influenced by everything the people i love say to me 
for example if my mother who is mentally ill herself  and i am definitely taking everything she says with a grain of salt  tells me she thinks the people i hang with are weird i start to ruminate for weeks on end if she could be right  even though i was comfortable with those people beforehand and felt like the people are the best that could ever happen to me same with other lifestyle choices or similar things like i said the opinion of strangers really doesnt affect me but its the people nearest to myself that are unknowingly influencing my day to day life and decisions and i really suffer from that 
i am trying to tell myself that its their opinion and if i felt good in the first place then its nothing wrong with going the path i choose but theres always the thought of maybe the others could be right or they couldnt like me anymore if i am not acting the way they would be acting

i would appreciate if somebody has some sort of advice or even if someone has the same experience
what can i do to get over this and be free in my own skin and in my decisions

thank you for reading ",1
"my doctor told me to lower my stress i 20f went to the doctor and my blood pressure was measured at 150 from stress i was told i’m at risk for developing serious health problems and i have been trying to lower stress and anxiety but i haven’t had any success i have tried to fix diet and sleeping habits but i haven’t noticed a difference i also used to enjoy meditation but i have too much stress and anxiety now to do it properly without being overwhelmed with stressful thoughts there isn’t a clear cause for this but i did go through a lot of traumatic events throughout my life so i know they played a part i am currently in therapy which helps with the feelings around the events but the anxiety and stress seems to be constant does anyone have any tips or recommendations on how to reduce cortisol

"hypnagogic hallucinations auditory at night anyone else experience these i have really severe ptsd and anxiety from multiple traumas over the past 34 years stress from what i understand can cause hypnagogic hallucinations and i have experienced them in the past but last night they were pretty bad

so i woke up at about 430am this morning and from that point on every time i would start to drift off to sleep i would hear a small dog yapping or someone knocking or something rubbing against the wall or a bird singing and various other sounds with each new sound i would wake up very anxious and in a panic and would try to go back to sleep againonly to be awakened by another sound just as i was falling asleep

after this happened about 6 different times i finally just got up and was feeling extremely anxious by this point but took my meds and have calmed down a little bit

anyone else here ever go through this thank you",1

"is there anxiety medications that could work as well for me as codeine  tremadol before you say anything im aware of the addictive nature of opioids and how self medication isnt a good idea i dont need a lecture

i have had codeine on and off for a few years usually only on days or periods when i have felt really bad i have been taking vyvanse 70mg the last 2 years and have that most days it helps with other stuff but not with anxiety one of my biggest anxieties is making phonecalls its always bad i would always rather email or text but its worst when theres people in the roomin the office i just cant do it so last friday i knew i had to make a lot of calls so i had my vyvanse in the morning and codeine too i couldnt bring myself to make the calls in my office but i went to an empty room and made 20 calls and the stupidest thing is i enjoyed it i enjoyed talking to the people there is still no way id do it with others in the room it makes me far too anxious 

so this week ive been having tremadol and vyvanse every morning it has been working nicely im far less anxious and much more social and talkative with my colleagues but ofc it isnt a long term solution ive been on a few ssris over the years which have helped with my mood some of the time but have never helped with the anxiety that i recall ive also had propranolol which does help with the physical symptoms of heightened anxiety sweating shaking stuttering and elevated heart rate for example but they dont help so much with the mental side of the anxiety in my experience 

im wondering what medications are actually avaliable that might have similar benefits to my anxiety as tremadol and codeine seem to i just dont know if i want to spend weeks or months taking something that may or may not work and barely being able to tell if it is or not vyvanse and codeine i know that they help my symptoms

"has anyone here used a rage room what is the experience like and are they worth it a nephew of mine whos been stressed out and actually been to a fight at a restaurant luckily he and the person he exchanged blows with got scared when a security guard came and bothran away in terror like scared cats and there was no camera footage and neither are known by the stuff and people who frequently eat there decided to go to a rage room where you pay cash and they give you stuff to bteak with a hammer and sledgehammer the time you can spend there and what equipment they give you for smashing stuff and the kind of objects you get to wreck apart is dependent on which package you choose and it can range from a couple of cd albums and picture frames to a desk allt he way to a car and  your package selection gives you either a small hammer  chopping axe  and sledge hammer even jackhammer and chainsaw for more expensive packages  you are wearing full protection from visors to  armored clothing and theres a stuff also in protection watching over your session to make sure nobody gets hurt

no im not lying theyre an actual thing they got so big lately that wikipedia has an article on it

my nephew has ben so stressed with paying the bills especially college loans and his girlfriend just dumped him his new boss is a prick and lots of pressure on him in his life in general its telling he never once got into a fight back iwhen he was in school and later in college of how bad the situation has gotten 

so he did a 30 minute session and was given a care with a desk and a bunch of smaller objects from vhs tapes to cd albums and plaques and old paintings and a few whole work desks and he spent time destroying them all not only did all his rage and internals tress go away afterwards that when i met him last night he was calm and pretty happy noticeable change from how the last cuple of times he seemed agitated even when there was nothing to be stressed out about in my home at a nearby bar and at the bowling alley and a few restaurants we ate at but despite his attempts to remain polite he showed signs of impatience and borderline losing it he told me it was so fun that not only will he come bac a lot but even if he wasnt stressed at all hed visit the rage room as a frequent customers just because smashing objects is fun and thats without any anger held inside him and daily life pressures

so im wondering if anyone else had use rage room and how is it like is it worth the price and did it help you put down your stress levels and internal wrath you been witholding lately",1
walked out of the doctors today my anxiety was so bad i usually control it if i am somewhere familiar my heart was racing so i put my head up against the wall behind me and tried to control my breathing the room started to spin and i was done it was the walk in clinic so it wasnt a massive deal to me to leave but my mother thought otherwise as i had a panic attack in the car she yelled and belittled me all the way home she doesnt have anxiety and will never understand its been a hard day ,1

"should i stop selfmedicating and seek professional help  ive been dealing with anxiety my whole life at my worst when i was 1820 i could barely get my hair cut at my best right now im constantly dealing with lowlevel anxiety thats making me procrastinate costing me sleep and is generally very draining 

despite my lifelong anxiety issues i consider myself to be successful ive been earning enough money to buy and pay off a home and i have an amazing wife  two even more amazing children however i dont believe that i would be where i am now without selfmedication and selftherapy from ltheanine to kratom to phenibut to cbd to act my anxiety toolbox is always full and it has been this way since forever 

the problem is that im kinda tired of being my own doctor and i think that for the first time in my life im considering consulting my issues with a professional my gp specifically i would like to give betablockers a try i have isolated systolic hypertension 14080 and have actually been put on them in the past i stopped taking them because they gave me ed but it also could have been anxiety 

the reason why im writing is that im not 100 sure if the switch from selfmedication to professional help is the right thing to do considering that ive become quite good at selfmedicating is there anyone whos been in a similar situation has seeking professional help paid off",1
"made a post on here a while ago… yeah so i made a post on here about half a year ago the morning before i started my first semester of community college a few very kind and polite people commented that they were available to chat if i needed someone and i really appreciate that they did but i feel really terrible because i just kind of ignored them… 

my semester was very awful i went through the entire thing feeling alone unengaged and bored out of my damn mind i was exhausted from just being there despite not participating in anything outside of my going to lectures and doing my basic schoolwork one person in my eng 1101 was actually super polite to me engaging with me a lot in conversation and talking about common interests despite my off putting aura of dread i bring with my depression and social anxiety i couldn’tcan’t start a conversation to save my life like an idiot i never talked to them outside of class or anything i figure someone that nice with friends already doesn’t need something like me

now i can’t go back to college am broke and have never had a job i’m 19f but turn 20 this year and my life feels like a waste no friends and hide from my family in our own home in embarrassment therapy doesn’t work for me and i have terrible social anxiety and depression— possibly even agoraphobia i make up a million excuses for why i can’t leave my house what if my dogs miss me my hair is ugly my face is ugly i have no nice clothes etc i feel as if i have separation anxiety from my own dog and my house

i am praying  you can help me navigate this difficult time 



i’m in a slow recovery from 6 
months of intense facial pain daily unrelenting pain all right side 

we’ve located the underlying issue and physical pain is lessening but what i have now is a serious mental health crisis with daily panic attacks horrific anxiety attacks sometimes with psychosis 

i’m now awaiting a bed at a psych hospital for more evaluation they think my brain has been ‘damaged’ by too much pain so post traumatic brain chemistry damage’ 

i’ve just started taking lorazepam having just stopped oxazepam 


pain meds are now to a minimum but in the past 5 months i’ve been a pharmaceutical garbage dumb 

carbamazepine amitriptylineoxcarbazpine tramadol oxycodon  halidol ive stopped all of these 6 

my question is for those of you who deal with this mental health issue 

1 how can i help myself in an episode
2 how can i do effective breathing when i’m hyperventilating 

3 when i feel the ‘aliens’ are coming and i can’t get out of the whirlpool of the anxiety attack  what can i do 

i’m now fearing these episodes and that doesn’t help

"coworker laughed when i complimented her at work advice  


to begin 30f and i 25m started working together recently she’s been at the company insurance company for 10 years and i just started 7 months ago we hardly spoke one on one and i never really bothered to establish a relationship with her besides just being cordial when we’d see each other and had to interact very cordial like nothing spicy everything work related and convos were short enough

i had a feeling recently that she has someone grown to dislike me in a way and she was talking negatively about me behind my back apparently she thinks i’m serious all the time i’m just workoriented by nature but i guess her extroverted personality seemed to clash with mine out of fear that my manager would see me as an issue for nothing fitting into the clique i began talking more than i felt comfortable with and was able to make others laugh here and there with jokes and stuff she seemed to slowly get off my back just a little 

i decided to message her directly with a question on teams saying hey you’re smart  what do we do when xxx happens and we only have xyz it was a work related question with a simple harmless compliment she laughed at my comment then answered my question out of curiosity i asked her what’s so funny and she said i said haha to your you’re smart lol and i said yea you’re smart you don’t think so at the end of the day it’s a compliment based on observation  she says yes haha thanks that’s so kind 

and that was that i have a feeling she might’ve seen this as flirting advice  if this is worth noting she asked me if i was dating in front of all my coworkers when we all had a dinner and the topic of dating came up and i was silent throughout most of it just listening to others i caught her looking at me 6 times during the dinner i overheard her talking to he friend how they’re frustrated about dating and how dating apps don’t work for them",1

"looking for some advicesupport to understand why i feel the way i do at the moment hi

i 36f could really do with some help understanding whats going on with my brain a bit of context first will try to keep it brief

ive never had issues with anxiety or any other areas of my mental health previously im not always the most confident of people but equally i have always been very good at dealing with stress

about a year and a half ago i started a new office job it was in a very serious field came with significant responsibilities and was undoubtedly very stressful we had members of the wider team have mental breakdowns it was an extremely challenging work environment everything was very stressful i stuck it out for over a year but it had a significant impact on me mentally at the time  from dreading work at the weekends feeling constantly nervous at work to even taking sleeping tablets at one stage because i couldnt switch off when i was trying to sleep

i left that job a couple of months ago and now have a new job its a much nicer job with the normal levels of stress and responsibility that comes with any office job the issue is i am still extremely stressed and anxious at and about work

i dread getting emails a get really nervous ahead of even minor meetings i wake up almost every morning with a tight chest and heart beating fast etc which lasts most of the morning i stress about work on the weekend even though theres nothing to stress about i cant shake it

i know without a doubt that i have no justification for being this stressed and anxious i discuss with my partner and when we try and break it down the answer to what exactly is it youre stressed about is essentially nothingi dont know its like my mind knows ive no logical reason to be stressed but my body is in this constant fightflight mode that i cant get out of

i have a doctors appointment soon but im kind of worried about turning up and saying hi  im really stressed and anxious all the time at work for no reason

can it get better without therapy i have horrible insurance very little income and a deep fear of talking to any kind of medical professional ive gone many times in the past when i was more financially stable and it never went anywhere as id have panic attacks before a session and not be able to join or over freak out over the price of the sessions i cant do therapy right now but it feels like my problems are just getting worse i dont remember the last time my stomach didnt hurt my head is so foggy all the time and the panic attacks are more and more frequent i just want to know if theres any hope without access to therapy or if im just going to get worse until i magically get over all my fears and have money to throw around,1

"my mental health has been getting way worse it’s always something with me i’m 19 and always stressed out constantly due to being anxious at home bc of my mother i had the best time of my life at college bc i was away from my home 2 hrs away and felt independence and freedom obviously i still had a lot of bad times but overall i was 10x happier in college it’s summer break now and it’s absolutely miserable again i have nothing to look forward to anymore 

i’m stressed constantly about things i have to do i had an assignment due the 2nd week of may that i completely forgot to send the second part of when my professor emailed me about it in the middle of may i went on 2 trips back to back and just submitted the rest 12 weeks ago and i’m afraid i won’t get credit for the class  that he won’t contact me back i checked online a while ago that i had an extension for the class until july 1st i’ve been so scared to check if he just put my grade in without replying back to me and my mom keeps asking me about the class  i’m extremely afraid of her yelling at me and belittling me if i don’t pass bc of this and i really don’t want to fail it’s not even that my other grades are bad either i have a’s and b’s just this class i’m scared abt i might just lie abt it but i feel like she’s going to ask to see the grade online unlike when she first asked now i wasted her money on a class and i’m really scared and feel bad about it 

just everyday feels the exact same except it gets more miserable that it’s dreadful constantly rotting in my bed i used fo love fashion gaming and learning little weird things so much even if i was still going through a depressive episode those things would be something i’d still engage it while being disinterested in everything else now it hasn’t even been making me happy and it’s upsetting me i feel like that one scene in the lorax where everything turns gray and lifeless i also feel like a failure for being depressed anxious paranoidat home with mom and a big ass procrastinator i have a piano guitar a sewing machine  games i haven’t finished and art supplies but i haven’t picked up any of it because of my lack of motivation regardless  of how long i wanted to learn and love these these things i’m still either ass mediocre or haven’t touched it bc of this i am an artistic person but a lost cause since i just think about it and can’t do 

also do you remember when i said college was the best experience i’m not even as excited to go back now other than gaining independence and freedom again the group of friends i made 2nd semester i found out some of the people did some weird things and idk if i can see them those 3 the same anymore especially one of my closest friends i loved my friends so much and it was the best part about school but ite definitely not going to feel the same as the first year but who knows this isn’t that big of a deal to me other than it being awkward but it is just unfortunate that they probably aren’t the best ppl to hang around as often 

there’s way more i could yap about but  this sums how i feel up on friday i am going to get diagnosed for adhd and get prescribed some medication so i hope it improves my mood i’m on antidepressants but it hasn’t been doing anything now that i’m more stressed during summer break and my mom has been stressing me out ",1

"anxiety or brain damage  pcan i get brain damage in sleep due to sleeping on neck awkwardly 

for context i already struggle with dissociation anxiety and brain fog recently ive been waking up sleeping funny on my neck it leaves my head feeling numb which goes away once i move around i wake up very confused anxious and scared and it feels like blood rushes back to my body and my digestive system kicks in once i move my neck around my cognitive abilities as of late have been significantly impaired memory focus concentration this is likely due to my mental health issues but im worried that the way ive been sleeping can lead to brain damage due to restricting blood flow to the brain i already struggle and the thought of it contributing to my cognitive issues really scare me 

is this something i should be worrying about or is it an unlikely cause of any damage to the brain

"imaginary scenarios leading to anxiety attack  hi guys i was wondering if anyone else experienced this im in the middle of exam season and have always been extremely anxious when it comes to exams tests presentations there is this one specific class that i know i wont have a good enough grade to pass and that i will have to do an oral exam in front of a jury to have a better grade i was thinking about how it will all go how anxious and nervous i will be right before the exam i started imagining the whole scenario and basically set off an anxiety attack it creeped in very slowly and i felt it coming but nonetheless i couldnt stop thinking about it continued imagining all of it and adding more and more details that made me feel even worse why is that why cant i just stop thinking about it and focus and the task at hand

i would love to know if this happens to other people as well and not just me and if anyone has some tips in how to prevent situations like that from escalating usually when i talk about it with people in my environment the goto answer is just stop thinking about it if i could i would but my brain just does not shut off",1

how do you all cope with a sudden kick up of symptoms how do you deal with the battle between wildly anxious and depersonalized the more extra anxious i feel the more my anxiety hangs onto the worse feeling and spirals into the this is it youll never recover from this one youre going to end up having a break and in a psychiatric facility etc etc ",1

"does anybody else feel this way hey everyone i’m a 27 yo male and i’ve been struggling with anxiety for years now but recently it’s gone through the roof to the point where i needed to ask my employer to work remotely so i can be in my own space while i figure it out 

i feel like i’ve become overwhelmed by literally everything about my life from the outside my life looks pretty good i have a great girlfriend two great dogs and a supportive family but i feel like up to this point i’ve just sort of been coasting through life without truly learning from my experiences and it’s all rushing into the forefront now  to the point where i feel like i don’t know anything like my mind is blank and i can’t even have a normal conversation  i feel like my worrying has taken the place of critical thought and i’ve regressed so much i have hope that i can get better but i don’t know where to start i’ve read about depersonalization and that’s sort of what this feels like 

has anyone felt this kind of anxiety and if so how did you deal with it ",1
"can stress cause lack of morning erections since me and my girlfriend split ive been having bouts of intense stress and anxiety ive noticed when im doing meditation i seem to have more erections maybe due to lower stress

its hard for me to get back into meditation and controlling my stress since sometime my anxiety seems super intense and then i get into a negative feedback loop

im just wondering could this chronic stress and anxiety be causing a lack of morning erections

im a very healthy 26 year old male ive been trying to abstain from porn and masturbation to help i also just quit nicotine about 2 weeks ago and i eat a healthy predominately plant based diet i eat meat occasionally as well so its a well rounded diet

the only problems ive been having trouble with is stressanxiety and in return its been messing with my sleep its been very hard for me to stay asleep past 34 hours without waking 

is there anything i should check bloodwork wise cortisol or prolactin 

i also go to therapy but it doesnt seem to be helping a bunch i just feel like im venting a lot without much change

any insight would be greatly appreciated",1

"numbness from stress im a 19m whos been extremely stressed the past 3 months 2 weeks ago ive been feeling pretty numb from almost my entire body and have been having some sort of very bad brain fog

2 days ago i felt my numbness is getting stronger and it still is my body and mind just dont feel right i feel like a walking zombie ive lost a lot of my sensations in my arms like i can touch scolding hot water not for so long as it does give some burning feeling albeit not too strong 

its currently really cold outside and while i do feel quite cold with a hoodie everybody is cold while wearing a jacket and i get used to the cold 

i went to the doctor on thursday and they told me its just anxiety and stress and that i should change my lifestyle but its odd because it feels like its gotten worst my head also feels like part of it is empty or missing or just isnt there 

i think its also worth noting that my body has been quite hot too since this numbness started and my thermometer keeps saying i somewhere between 985  997 only once did it reach 1001 i also develop and pretty bad dry cough a few hours before i go to bed 

i was wondering if anybody else feels all these symptoms or at least some of them ive been very fearful about this and im gonna see my doctor again tomorrow to try to get a referral for a neurologist",1

"help what do i do my mom and i got into a fight like we always do i asked her about summer school what i have to do and whatever since i still don’t know my schedule and i asked her other things like if there was a buzz in door because those doors give me so much bad anxiety i just absolutely hate trying to open the door realizing it’s locked then realizing it’s a buzz in door buzzing in and standing there like an idiot while they talk to me and mom said it probably is because all of the schools there are under high security

i told her that i didn’t want to do summer school because it is so unnecessarily complicated and gives me anxiety i asked her if i could just drop out and do the ged instead and she started listing all of the things i have to pay for if i drop out the ged driver’s ed etc and then she ended it by screaming at me and saying that i’m definitely doing the summer school

i have to wake up early because mom is refusing to drive me to the school so i have to walk over an hour and 30 minutes by myself through a field since there is no sidewalk there it takes 6 minutes to drive there but lucky for me i don’t have a car and no one can drive me

i feel selfish for not wanting to do summer school because i don’t want people to think that i look like an idiot is it selfish to have social anxiety and try to act in my own selfinterest so i don’t have panic attacks

i don’t know what to do and i am having such bad anxiety i have to go to school in 12 hours 12 minutes i don’t know what to do

my social anxiety is caused by my fear of being judged and that everyone thinks i’m an idiot because i genuinely don’t know what i’m doing i hate going to new places because of this so i lock myself in my room all day every day when i had my winter job i embarrassed myself daily because i didn’t know what i was doing—it was my first job—and my manager was oh so kind to tell me everything i was doing wrong and tricked me into doing things that weren’t our tasks he tricked this one guy into tightening all the screws on the chairs in the 2story building but i was so busy working that i didn’t have time to dwell on my mistakes and overthink them so my social anxiety got better and went away a little bit

but now that my winter job is over for a long time now and i’m in my room 247 only talking to people i know and only staying in places i know my social anxiety is back to its usual horrible level

should i just suck it up and stop being a baby or do you have better advice",1

so it allll started when my aunt told me that she was getting her colonoscopy done because shes of age to do so and she came back clear then my brain decided to look up what a colonoscopy was and thats when all hell broke loose

i found colonrectal cancer on ✨️ google ✨️ and saw the symptoms a few days after that i was presenting one of the symptoms which were blood on the stool and constipation basically begged my mom to take me to the er they did an exam said i was good gave me laxatives and went home laxatives worked so boom that was done

fast forward to today i had bm almost every day this week and i was constipated and today i had a bm and there was blood again my mind again went immediately to me dying and having cancer and searching on google blah blah blah 

and adding onto this i went to the doctor constantly ever since spring break till now and the doctors each time says that nothing is wrong and im fine but i feel like there is and i believe that 99 of that is bc of this anxiety its gotten to the point where i got not one but two blood tests in the same arm and now my arm is bruised

me f24 and my boyfriend m25 are currently living together in my city we are both from different countries and we did one year of long distance before moving in together he has to go back to his country to finish one semester of uni so i will go with him on erasmus there the problem is that after that semester so january 2025 we have no idea what’s next both of us will be finished with our studies and both of us want to study some more

it might seem like this will all happen in a long time but i feel like everything i can rely on is falling apart my family is a big mess and long story short i have a mother and younger brother that i’ve been kinda taking care of for the last year i’m very scared to leave them behind so i feel like i should go back to my country after erasmus i’ve been living in my own apartment for couple of years and i feel really anxious about losing that as well because returning home to my childhood room is not an option when i go on erasmus we have to leave our apartment behind because our landlord doesn’t want us to sublet it my boyfriend is thinking about studying in london which is just way to expensive for me so there is a possibility of him and me separating or maybe doing long distance again which i really don’t want to return to

that’s why the thought of january 2025 freaks me out i’ve tried talking to my therapist about it and even though she’s been great in a lot of things she told me that i’m young and i’m gonna figure it out which didn’t help

"diagnosed with gad after developing fear of nuclear war title pretty much sums it up my father very unexpectedly passed away in december 2021 

when russia invaded ukraine in february 2022 i’ve began having a concrete belief that at any moment regardless of what was actually happening at that point in time that me my family my friends and everyone would die in a instant no warning nothing or even with some warning i would worry that russia’s war would very quickly escalate with the west 

prior to being diagnosed i had a fair amount of knowledge regarding the deterrence of global super powers but i viewed nuclear weapons as just that  deterrence not something to be used actively but to stop things from spiralling out of control

and now since 2022 my view has completely 180’d there are days where i’m fully convinced that no matter what the war in ukraine is just going to escalate and escalate and everything’s is going to end in a full nuclear confrontation 

and having this outlook stops me from doing pretty much anything i cannot leave my home i cannot watch live tvbroadcasts the fear of a eas appearing i cannot plan for the future

this last year i have really been trying to find anything that will help me to take the edge off of the amount of anxiety i feel both daily and in situations like having to teach in front of 8th graders lol i have tried propanolol zoloft lexapro and wellbutrin so far and nothing has given me any sort of relief i dont know if i am expecting the medication to do something that it will never do but i feel like my anxiety has never been any better since trying these different medications should i request to see a psychologist instead because even my doctor has mentioned that it may be hard to get the right dosing for you because you are a redhead and you metabolize things differently i dont even know if that is true but i feel like my doctor has been very conservative in the dosing of the medications we have tried so far honestly this search for medications has gotten really exhausting i know it is a long process and i think i am just getting in my own head but i just feel like my doctor will think im making this up because how can 4 different medications do absolutely nothing for me i would just love any advice for either medications or nonmedications that help with anxiety as i am feeling quite stuck in my situation right now thank you ",1

this was an incredibly tough time for her where her anxiety made her struggle to join meetings during this time i knew something was wrong i would wake up in the middle of the night to find her sick over the toilet at first i thought she might be ill but she had turned to drinking to help her cope 

after asking her whats was wrong she confessed what had been happening and stopped drinking the issue became that since she is now unable to leave our flat due to the fear of having a panic attack 

a few weeks i managed to encourage her to come just outside the flat with me which went really well until she went a bit further had an attack and has now not left the front door since 

i am being patient and only encouraging her to go out when she feels ready but im worried if i am enabling her behaviour i have been encouraging her to go into therapy but she keeps putting this off i believe worried that she will never be able to remove her anxiety

1• you have to face your anxiety head on if you have a fear of going out go out even if it’s just for 10 seconds then one minute five minutes then 10 minutes etc 


2• you must remember and tell yourself that you will be okay no matter what your head is saying panic attacks will not hurt you they are not harmful they are just a natural emotion that’s being used in the wrong place at the wrong time

3• you will have setbacks and it will be extremely terrifying in the beginning but the first time is always the hardest you can do this

4• do meditation get enough sleep exercise and eat well you must remember your medication if you need it and you must remember to look after yourself in this journey

5• most importantly don’t fight your anxiety just accept it and tell yourself okay this is an uncomfortable feeling but it won’t harm me no matter how uncomfortable it feels carry on as normal as possible when anxiety arises and do not constantly check to see if your anxiety has gone you can rate the anxiety when it starts and view it from an outsiders perspective but don’t check constantly 

6• this will take time but remember you’re not in this alone ❤️",1

"i kicked phone anxietys butt today i had a meltdown and spent the majority of my morning crying or sitting on the toilet either shitting or gagging why because i want my old job backmy new one is so stressful to me to the point that i work maybe two hours a week i cant afford the therapy im starting and have no insurance for medication i put in an application and have been waiting a looooooooong time for a response its been a full year since i quit with no notice dont do that 

anyway after a lot of journaling about how i feel and writing some affirmations i picked up the phone and called the place i want to work at i had a general script in front of me so i could look back and see what i wanted to say but they picked up the phone and at that point i didnt look at it at all i said what i wanted to say with little to no stuttering or freezes the call lasted maybe three minutes

i wanted to kick myself so bad for worrying so much about the call because what really could have gone wrong in what world would they laugh at me or get angry with me for making a call and expressing that i wanted to come back and work for them

i dont know if i will get my old job back or not i really really hope i do i was miserable but i also had friends there and i was making a good amount of money i loved how many steps i was getting in day how physical the job was i felt strong and useful i desperately want to be able to provide for my husband like he has for me over the past year i want to have a safety net if we ever decide to have a child i want to be able to afford to take him to the beach and have him teach me how to swim i want to be able to afford therapy and any medications i may want to try there are so many more goals i have in mind but i just wanted to post this even if i dont get it i still tried despite feeling so much negative emotions over it

i did it and the anxiety didnt kill me it made me want to die but it didnt kill me 

now i just need to work on the anxiety on whether or not ill get a call ",1

i part own and run a company with 25 staff i have three children and one dog 

for the last four years onoff i have suffered from the following symptoms anxiety stress headaches gerd fatigue  nausea more recently  dizzyness with nausea and muscle pain 

can this is all stem from stress my bloods are normal my heart is normal  blood sugar is all good  the only aspect medically is my iron is slightly low 63 but still considered within range i also randomly have good days where i feel perfect however they are becoming quite rare 

i find that exercise helps but last week i had a hernia op so can’t currently exercise which is more than likely why my symptoms are now becoming even worse mainly nausea muscle pain and dizziness which makes it very hard to function normally 

can anyone relate any advice would be very much appreciated as i want to beat it 

thank you in advance ",1
"medication for airplane anxiety for a quick background i had my first panic attack when i was 8 like trying to open the doors of our moving car on the high way kind of panic attack i had one more as a kid where i thought i was dying and my mom had to pin me down to stop me from calling the police then that was it i didn’t have any more 

my anxiety returned when i was in college interning at a pi attorney and had to look at crash scene photos to collect for depositions this time my panic attacks manifested as me feeling like i couldn’t breathe and my heart was out of rhythm it took me months to realize they were panic attacks i even called a cardiologist thinking something was wrong with my heart someone once called an ambulance for me because i had a panic attack in a restaurant bathroom and thought i was dying

since then my anxiety has gone through better and worse times there have been lengthy periods of time where i cannot be a passenger in a vehicle without starting to have a panic attack there have been periods of time where i couldn’t even drive without freaking out sometimes it’s going into store with fluorescent lights that triggers it it’s random and will happen consistently for a period of time and then stop for months

i’ve done really well the last few years recently i was supposed to go on a trip with my oldest daughter for girl scouts about 5 hours away knowing my history with being the passenger in a car i paired up with a mom i’m friends with to drive because i knew she would pull over to let me drive if i needed it usually knowing i can get out and switch to drive is enough to keep me chill but the car was small it was packed to the brim with all of our stuff the girls were loud directly behind me and i lost it i made it about 20 minutes from home when i had to pull over and get dropped off in an ihop parking lot and have my mil come pick me up and take me home while my daughter continued on the trip it was so embarrassing

well now my fear of the fear has me terrified of all travel where i am not fully in control where i can’t just turn around and get home quickly 

my daughter’s gs troop is planning a trip to europe in 3 years and i’m already scared the same thing is going to happen except 10 times worse because it’ll be an 85 hour plane ride and not just a 5 hour car ride i’ve never had plane anxiety before i’ve flown cross country my whole life but after the episode earlier this year my brain has realized travel  not being in control the fact that i’ll be trapped in a floating tube has me scared for the first time

for those of you with travel anxiety does medication help i know my dad took xanax before every flight for many many years but i’m terrified of it not working for me and losing my shit for an 85 hour plane ride since the trip isn’t for another 3 years i have time to try to figure out what i’m going to do to make it through it ",1

"what are your coping strategies a discussion about mine when i find myself in the unpleasant situation of stressing out or even having anxiety attacks i follow some coping strategies have helped me navigate through these experiences one significant approach is trying to stay present and deal with the emotions instead of attempting to disassociate this has made significant progress in my personal journey regarding this issue every time you set the problem aside it often returns even bigger of course theres no one fixed answer for what to do in these moments as stress and anxiety are phenomena that every single human being experiences to some extent therefore each person has their unique way of dealing with it and for some it takes more effort than for others

moreover ive found it really interesting how sticking to a small routine or ritual within a day helps bring a sense of stability and consistency that keeps me grounded and more focused making it easier for me to manage my stressors mine is skin care but it can vary depending on the individual

an interesting article i came across on the web examines the properties of chamomile and whether it can help people dealing with stress galante et al 2017 the authors mentioned how chamomile is one of the most widely used herbal remedies in the world and that it is included in the pharmacopoeia of 26 countries as a fun fact the use of chamomile as an herbal remedy dates back to ancient greece and rome and since i am greekcypriot and chamomile has been in my culture we always kind of associate it with relaxing or sleeping

some other techniques that ive heard from friends find helpful include journaling and trying to limit screen time the impact of social media on our mental health is substantial but thats a topic for another discussion

"my symptoms disappeared after i got sick flu tldr

 male 25 years old good physical health i have ibs
 symptoms i have been experiencing shortness of breath for 10 months accompanied by chest pressure and occasional pain the symptoms have worsened despite reducing my stress and improving my quality of life i have had tinnitus for 6 months i occasionally smell blood with no apparent source
 symptoms improve when i lie down or sleep and worsen when i exercise
 when i got the flu the symptoms disappeared completely except for the tinnitus and reappeared about 5 days after the flu symptoms disappeared

i have found many cases about shortness of breath but not one like this i am writing this mainly to see if anyone has experienced the same or at least something similar or if anyone has any idea what it could be due to that said the situation is complex i guess it always is with these types of disorders so i dont see any other way to explain it than to tell the whole story

full history

i am a 25yearold man with a normal weight in early 2023 i started having stomach problems too frequent acid reflux heartburn and pain so i went to the gastroenterologist and after several tests he told me that it was almost certain that i had ibd this affected me a lot as i do not have the necessary income to cover all the expenses of this disease in september 2023 at night after finishing a particularly stressful job i started to feel very strong heartbeats while i was falling asleep and the next day the shortness of breath began that would accompany me to this day

during the first few weeks the shortness of breath was not that strong sometimes it was almost imperceptible but it arrived consistently every day at different times mainly in the afternoonevening another symptom that i started to notice was a constant chest pressure but bearable i could easily ignore it i also occasionally felt chest pain especially in the heart area after the symptoms persisted for a week i went to the doctor and thats where i was diagnosed with anxiety

in view of this i decided to make changes in my life to reduce stress factors i started to exercise more take more sun accept fewer jobs that could cause me stress and take fewer subjects in the school semester these measures really helped me reduce stress and i feel considerably more relaxed but the shortness of breath far from improving has been getting worse over the months

in early 2024 i started having constant tinnitus in my right ear which has not disappeared i decided to have an ekg blood tests and see a cardiologist the study came out normal and the doctor told me that due to my age it was unlikely that i had any physical condition reaffirming the diagnosis of anxiety this reassured me on the one hand but it was frustrating not to have certainty about how to combat my symptoms i started going to a psychologist with this problem and he has been helping me with different relaxation techniques and we are still looking for some possible subconscious trigger for anxiety because superficially everything seems fine i also received the good news that i had ibs not ibd as i was initially told all this helped me with stress and i think it fixed my insomnia to some extent but the shortness of breath continues

so far the only effective way to reduce the intensity of shortness of breath is to lie down or fall asleep if the symptoms are mild then lying down makes them disappear almost completely but as the intensity has increased lying down is becoming less and less effective on the other hand falling asleep has always worked the symptoms disappear when im dozing like when im riding the bus and i start to fall asleep while im still conscious but as soon as i wake up they soon reappear another thing that helps me a little is to take a deep breath in through my nose and mouth and hold the air for a bit before releasing it in fact ive gotten used to doing that unconsciously every few minutes and its what has helped me ignore the shortness of breath relatively

and although i have been monitoring them the symptoms do not seem to follow a specific pattern they simply appear and disappear out of nowhere at any time of day regardless of the activity i am doing or my mental state at least consciusly the may last a couple of minutos or even a couple of hours the only trigger i have found is exercise specifically i do calisthenics and weightlifting the air where i live is too polluted to go for a run

another symptom that i had been ignoring until now because i took it as a mental suggestion is that i sometimes perceive a smell of blood in my nose but i have not had nosebleeds or anything like that initially it happened once or twice a week but that has also increased and now it can happen even several times a day no doctor has given me an explanation for this

the curious thing about the matter is the following in march 2024 there was a day that the shortness of breath did not appear at any time it is as if it had disappeared until then i had had shortness of breath for a few moments every day without fail but that day was the first in half a year that i did not have shortness of breath during the night i started coughing a lot but i didnt pay much attention and the next day i knew i was sick i had a very high fever that left me exhausted in bed it felt as strong as when i had covid so i suspected covid but according to the doctor it was just the flu i didnt took any medicine just waited for my inmune system to do its job

the fever lasted 3 days and the cough about a week but during that whole time i did not have shortness of breath chest pressure or pain nor did i perceive any strange smell even 4 days after the flu symptoms disappeared i still had no shortness of breath and it was one of the most pleasant weeks of the year for me unfortunately from the 5th day on the symptoms returned starting with the chest pressure followed by the shortness of breath and chest pain

the truth is that i am not 100 sure that my symptoms are due to anxiety but i like to believe that they are they are annoying but i can live with them what i dont want is to discover that i have physical problems that i have been ignoring thats why i am writing this to seek comfort in a way to know if there is anyone else who has experienced this combination of symptoms and if you think this should be in another subreddit or that there is a better page to post it i would appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction i already know that a doctor is always the best option but i have already spent a lot on consultations and i am trying to save as much as possible

i hope someone can help me with this sorry for the long post and thank you for reading",1

"constant anger at one pressing issue all right guys i hope i don’t sound pathetic 

basically growing up i was raised in a house where my father was domestically abusing my mother and no one knew i came to a western country as an immigrant and soon afterwards my father’s parents’ died and he became extremely mentally ill and started hitting my mother in front of me and my sister 

during high school i started selfharming to deal with the stuff going on at home and having to continue living my life as if nothing had happened then i admitted myself to the hospital twice because i was suicidal 

basically the problem i’m having is that i’m constantly angry at everyone and everything and while the focus on this post is not my background i thought it’d be worthwhile explaining it so you readers can understand where i’m coming from 

what’s actually getting on my nerves is how i wake up everything feeling constantly irritated for example one memory that really makes me upset is when i was 12 in high school and a boy said to me ‘suck my d’ randomly while i was trying to do my schoolwork and his two friends laughed at me for the rest of the year i was extremely uncomfortable being in the same classroom as him and most other boys because of them constantly bothering me i did not tell the teachers because they did not take bullying seriously at my school from that memory i’m angry at the boy yes but the people i’m most angry at are my parents because they told me they were doing me a favour by sending me to that school it was the best one where i live but really they threw me into the lion’s den and made me put up with verbal harassment for 2 years in the name of ‘having a better future’ 

fast forward to now i’m still dealing with frustration for the pettiest reasons as there is one colleague who i really don’t like because i helped her out on a project and she didn’t even acknowledge me during our end of year party and went so far as to try doing some of my job even though it’s not her responsibility i tried being nice to her and she has behaved so rudely to me 

overall i wake up everyday feeling like the world is against me and everyone tells me that they ‘care’ about me but the way they behave is the complete opposite 

i’m just wondering how do i deal with these emotions i see a psychiatrist every half year but even then i’m walking on a tightrope ",1

recently i’ve developed severe anxiety i’ve always had anxiety but it has gotten worse since february to the point where i am having constant panic attacks at work as well don’t eat barely leave the house and have physical symptoms 247 i’ve been in therapy for it and my therapist and i are discussing the medication route

after having a panic attack on monday and having to leave early i decided to take a leave of absence for the rest of the school year i was supposed to work until the 26th even with no kids there i emailed one of the associate principals that i was going through some health issues and he said i was fine and to take all the time i need

since taking my leave i’ve been doing a lot better but i also feel guilty because i don’t want it to affect my career i’m afraid that they won’t want me back next year even though they love me i’m not close with admin but all the teachersmain office ladies love me and i don’t want them to think that i did this for an early summer i’m feeling really guilty that i’m doing better and keep thinking “i should be at work right now” i’m also afraid that if i ever decide to go to a new district that if they contact my current school they will be told of my leave and not want me plus i know the whole school teachers probably know that i took a leave everyone’s business goes around and i’m kind of embarrassed 

please give me some advice i know taking a leave for my mental health was the right thing to do but i can’t help but feel guilty thanks in advance and sorry for the long post

tldr took a leave of absence for the rest of the school year to due to anxiety and panic attacks and feel guilty ",1

"just need to get some thing out there i don’t know how to keep this as straightforward and understandable as possible but i am just going to start somewhere

about 6 months ago i moved to a mediumsized city populationwise here in germany to go to university and possibly start a new life i have suffered from depression and anxiety for a few years now but until i moved here i was feeling relatively good

over the past few months i seem to have fallen into very anxietylike behavioral patterns i get extremely nervous talking to people i don’t want to leave my apartment i feel extremely uncomfortable in my own body and my thoughts often irritate me everyday transactional interactions like going to the doctor going to the supermarket or even writing emails are a huge challenge for me to the point where i sometimes straight up don’t do those tasks

talking to people is extremely hard i always leave my family on read for multiple days even though we don’t have any problems with each other i don’t text my friends because for some reason i feel anxious and like a burden or failure i don’t even know if i’m going to post this text because talking to strangers on the internet isn’t exactly easier for me i can’t keep deadlines and i haven’t been to university in weeks i think i am messing up my whole life right now i want to take myself to therapy but again i am too scared to even write an email asking if they take in new patients i want to believe i am not a hopeless case because i’ve seen myself feel okay but i don’t know how to get there again

there is so much more i want to get off my chest but every time i try to put my thoughts into words they just disappear as if i never had them i am very emotionally upset most of the time so this is the best i’ve got for now

"i’m tired of doctors dismissing my anxiety and not taking it seriously yesterday i had to go to a cardiologist for the first time because my primary doctor wanted to see if there was something wrong with my heart other than anxiety making my heart constantly race i went there and he asked me a bunch of questions some of them were kind of invasive like about if i could drive work who i lived with and if i was from around there if i liked the area i could tell right away he was getting super judgmental when i told him that mine was pretty bad and couldn’t leave the house much because of it

he told me from the very few minutes of meeting me that i seemed like a very nice person and that i looked fine that he had a son that dealt with a little anxiety and that i was still really young that i should do everything i could to get better and that i shouldn’t have to worry about my heart that he thought it was fine i told him that i’ve been dealing with this since my teens and that it felt like it gotten much worse with age he just had this blank look on his face as if he didn’t believe my anxiety was all that bad it was an extremely awkward and humiliating experience and the worst thing is i have to go back again tomorrow… i’m so tired of getting doctors like this it’s so infuriating they act like young people can’t have severe anxiety that prevents them from functioning properly",1
"i have anxiety and i need to tell a girl about it some advice last year i developed an anxiety where i get really nauseous and throw up most of the times anything that alters me or gets me anxious makes me nauseous and so in general i need to have a quick access to bathrooms anywhere i am even not having access to bathrooms makes me anxious 

i’m talking to this girl she’s rlly good and focused on her goals which is something i’ve always wanted in a girl 

take into consideration i developed this anxiety and throwing up when i was at a bad time at life right now i am happy i do jiujitsu and mixed martial arts i go to the gym i eat healthy sleep a lot have good friends although sometimes i feel lonely i have to admit i have a good social life i have a happy life the only reason i get anxious and throw up is because of the fear itself of getting anxious and throwing up it’s a vicious cycle 

i’ve only told a small amount of people about this when it was absolutely necessary and i’m not hanging out with this girl because i’m afraid i’ll throw up even though she has been asking me to hang out for a long time now and i always have to make excuses and so it’s deteriorating our “friendship” if you may call it that 

this was the text that i thought about sending to her any comments “i wanted to tell you something look the reason why i try to keep myself as peaceful as possible why i fight my ass off in mma and jiujitsu why i study as much as possible is because i try to keep myself in a focused and calm state constantly because anything that upsets me causes me to feel bad and make me feel nauseous or vomit it has not always happened to me just these last few months and im not really sure why when it started to happen to me i limited myself a lot in the things i did whether it was training or going out with friends now i am much better though and the truth is that you alter me but for good you excite me i get happy being with you and i want to keep talking to you but i wanted you to know that in case i feel bad while we hangout or something thats why probably at first it will happen but its not something thats always going to happen because the more i get used to something the less it happens to me
if now or at some point you get uncomfortable or annoyed just tell me and i have no problem but the truth is that i would like to see what happens with you but this is the reason that i havent invited you to hangout and if it isnt a cause for problem for you it wont be a problem for me either”",1

"whats a sign to get help hello

im 20yo and i think i have had anxiety since i can remember i used to care a lot about things getting very nauseous when going to school it was bad enough that my school counsellor had to get involved and they recomended me therapy when i was 9yo they also wanted to get me to a psychiatrist but i threw a tantrum one day and told my parents i didnt want to go so my progress stopped there at the end i never knew if i had something i found the paper of my report a few years ago hidden by my parents the paper has a conclusion where it says that i met the criteria for the diagnosis of generalized anxiety obssesive compulsive symptoms and anxiety of separation of course that paper is now very old and i dont think my diagnosis is valid anymore i still regret to this day telling my parents to stop therapy maybe that way i wouldnt have wasted this much of my life

i had felt stuck since then i have never felt happy im always waiting for something bad to happen and can never truly enjoy my life i have reached so many goals i made it into university got a job and travelled so many countries but still feel so empty and worried about every stupid thing and i believed for a while that if i had a job i wouldnt have to worry about money and that if i got an education i would stop worrying about the future but the truth now is that that has not happened the worries never go away and when i resolve something my brain finds a way to find another thing to worry about like a never ending cycle at this point i am so tired and so desperate to be happy and a month ago i tried going to a therapist

therapy involved talking about my feelings making lists of my worries meditating but i couldnt truly explain to them that my worries are not something that i can control even though i tried to they suffocate me by themselves i tried making a list understanding that i cannot change the past or have control over the future and even though i rationalize this and i am very aware the throughts are still there when i meditate and do the breathing exercises the worries are still there even when i can feel my toes touching the ground and i relax my shoulders and take air in that does not make me feel alive i dont want to sound rude but the truth is that ive lived with this for so many years that i tried everything i know my worries are dumb that is all inside my head but still my head is loud and out of my control

i wanted to ask now what is left i feel like this was easier when i was 9 because when you are a child and worry about big things people can notice that that is not normal but now i am an adult that still worries about big things which is a normal thing to do at my age what is a sign that i should have that made you go to the doctor and say this should not be normal is this all there is living like this",1
"my anxiety broke my bf’s heart hi everyone this year i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with anxious features and posttraumatic stress disorder but i have been struggling so much with this for years now for context i struggle with trauma from sa and infidelity and i have a disorganized mostly anxious attachment style

i have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now we are in a longdistance relationship we are really compatible have so much similarities and have aligned goals in the future we were planning to get married next year

but i messed up

today i got triggered by my trauma absolutely lost control and broke up with him i hurt him so much and broke his trust 

there were patterns from my past relationship where an ex would suddenly get addicted to video games and i would later find out that they were cheating on me and they would play nonstop together this happened repeatedly so the trauma is deep 

my bf does not play a lot but today he told me he had downloaded a game days prior and has been playing it it’s an online multiplayer game all of my trauma resurfaced and i felt so much fear and anxiety — my mind was wrongfully telling me i would lose him soon then i looked at myself and was so ashamed i got triggered over something so petty and superficial i thought it would be best to work on my trauma through therapy alone and single

i impulsively broke up with him on call and inflicted unbearable pain to him something i wouldn’t even want to happen to myself i broke his heart and i’m devastated i left him confused and scared and when i started thinking rationally i took it back

sometimes i just hate being like this i know i am responsible for my trauma but i’m hurt that i can do this to someone i love

i will have therapy soon i want to be my best self for my partner and for me as well i have asked for forgiveness genuinely and i want to be better

has anybody else experienced anything similar i have been sick since the beginning of january i had about a week where i felt good and about three days ago it came back  while being sick is no fun and i dont enjoy any of it i noticed that while im sick im not as anxious or depressed as i usually am  my mind is pretty much on getting better and making sure i dont get those around me sick  i am lethargic but its more from the sickness than the depression  but what ive noticed is that as i feel i am getting better everything hits like a ton of bricks  and my thoughts are way darker than usual and come out of nowhere   i can understand being distracted by being sick but what i dont get is why when i start feeling better its like there is a door keeping all of the mental issues locked away and when i start feeling better its like they kick the door down with a vengeance  just wondered if anyone has experienced anything similar  ,1

im curious to know if writing down and planning your things at the start of the day helps you release your stress   
when you write down a list of things do you follow the list of things to do and if they are all done by the end of the day does it make you feel better

im very anxious about side effect not saying everyone gets them but what id i get them how to handle it my doctor said if you get really anxious as side effects you can take oxazepam this sounds scary to me if i have to take oxazepam cause it signals possible bad side effectsofc i worry about this with gad 

did you guys had side effects first couple weeks if yes which one and how to deal with them

also important to know how bad was your situation and how did it improved

my main fear is getting depressed or suicidal thoughts or actually being that as a side effect i dont give a fuck about diarree or whatever as side effect i rather not have it tho",1
"anyone physically notice the change in your body when you change your medication schedule for me i recently changed medications stopped taking clonidine in the morning and now only take it at night and i can physically feel the “unaliving myself” thoughts just pop into my head out of thin air it’s so weird as i’m going through this minor adjustment in medications i’ve smoked a little thc to help the transition and i could literally feel the “thoughts” just dissolve instantly 

now that’s evidence of a chemical imbalance for sure",1

"cardiophobia anxiety and me 
this is gonna be a novel so let me say thank you for listening

i’m 31 6ft 4in 400lbs mostly cake probably and every single health exam or test says i’m extremely healthy despite my weight 

and i am irrationally terrified of my heart just plain stopping it’s only getting worse it’s ruined my life so far

before january 2020 i would have panic attacks yes but i was working through it at my own pace i was on still am on lexipro and hydroxyzen i was in the gym 4 days a week i was running miles i was swimming laps playing tennis on exercise bikes lifting weights busting my ass to lose weight and try to get in better shape i got myself down from 370 to about 330 and i was so damn proud of myself

but one day in january 2020 i was out on a work call in a nearby city i work in foster care and i was meeting some new kids that just got placed in a home i had been feeling unusually anxious more panicky more scared after that visit i went to the hospital i was having a bad panic attack but something compelled me to just go i was terrified at this small town er they hooked me up to an ekg machine they monitored me for a bit and when they came back the doctor sat down and said to me “there’s some kind of blip for lack of a better word on your ekg” i didn’t know what that meant for me what he said after is what has doomed me to this day “well we can’t rule out  heart attack so we think it’s best you transfer to the bigger hospital in the city over” 

that was it it was just my time i guess all the gym stuff all the time work and effort and it was just out the window they transported me to the hospital they gave me some kind of pill that opens up all the veins and arteries in your body wider “in the off chance you are having a heart attack” the emt said to me on the way the whole way there i just couldn’t stop thinking about that ekg just spacing out about it 

when i did get to the big city hospital i was checked in hooked up to another ekg and given an iv i laid there and i kept thinking “if i was having a heart attack wouldn’t i have had it by now” there was just so so much to process but one thing i couldn’t stop was the thought that my hearts going to fail the ekg at this hospital was showing just perfectly fine readings they did more tests and concluded i had a severe respiratory infection which would later be diagnosed as covid the pandemic started maybe 2 months after that

after i discharged from the hospital i felt like an absolute failure of a human being a 27 at the time year old man having a heart attack after the last year working to improve myself in the gym i dwelled on it i spent the first week home and not in the gym i tried to get back into the gym i did not work

it’s been downhill ever since then anytime i would start to run or swim and i could feel my heartbeat rising or my breath getting short from the workout i would go into hyperventilating panic i would cry i would stop and down my hydroxyzen and try to find something to keep my mind off it but i couldn’t my stomach would be in knots and that would just set the whole process off because severe stomach pain is a symptom of a heart attack it got so bad that even the thought of going to the gym gave me anxiety my first hobby lost to this monster i tried unsuccessfully to get myself into therapy but i never could find anyone in the field that couldn’t understand until i swapped psychiatrists and during one of our medication sessions she more or less diagnosed me with cardiophobia 

the monster had a name 

as the months passed i couldn’t go near a gym i started to have panic attacks just walking up and down stairs if i ate too much or too little and my stomach started to hurt i panicked because it was a symptom i have some nerve damage in my left arm due to an ancient and when it starts hurting it goes to heart attack because it’s my left arm and that’s a symptom too this day this is still the case it’s been 4 years 4 years of panic attacks almost daily i’m now 400 pounds my knees are hurting all the time now my heart rate rises my sanity falls i’ve gotten so big now that driving gives me anxiety i feel like i can’t breath sometimes when i drive and again shortness of breath is a symptom of a heartattack if i can’t drive i can’t work i have to work those kids depend on me i have student loans i have bills it’s the simplest things i’m a little dizzy heart attack upper back hurts probably a heart attack god forbid i have just regular old gas that makes my chest tight 

i’ve gone to the hospital so so so many times now  i’ll get in the car and just in my head i have to have a plot to the nearest hospital because “hey my breathings about to get heavy and i’m gonna panic while driving” and as soon as i think that boom it happens i’ve had ambulances come to me i’ve had coworkers do their best to calm me down i’ve been a burden on so many people now because of this god awful irrational fear my hearts just going got quit every specialist i’ve been to every exam i’ve ever had every check up has the same result i’m fine i’m very healthy my weight is up but that’s it my labs are solid i’m not diabetic i’m not actively falling apart but none of it matters there’s always that “well what if it’s this time” no one can ever truly know

as i type this i have been having an anxiety panic attack since 8pm it’s 5am my stomach won’t stop hurting my anxiety and panic is evolving past i’m dying and going to i’m dying and i’m going to lose my sanity i cry a lot these days now i can’t help it anymore i’ve lost so many hobbies and missed out on so much because i’m scared eventually i’m going to lose my job because i’ll be too afraid to get in my car anymore

a friend of mine told me once i was scared to live

how do you beat this how do you take back control from something like that i’m giving it another go at therapy and i’m deciding to try new medicine by changing my current meds they just arnt working anymore i’m hoping the new therapist will have better answers i’m hoping maybe new medicine will help me to coping one day maybe i’ll be free

one day i’ll be in that gym again",1

my question is if i should do that ct scan so i can know what i have or would you recommend me going to another doctor first before doing the ct scan

hi everyone

i know its not recommended to ask for medical advice online but i was wondering if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms ive already visited my doctor and while im happy nothing serious was found theres something that still feels off

im hoping someone here might have some insight or similar experiences im a 30 year old male and for the past few months ive been having occasional bouts of chest pressuretingling usually when im sitting down its not a sharp pain more like a weird sensation of someone touching tingling or pricking my chest it usually happens on the left side of my chest

i recently had my bloodwork done and my vitamin d levels were low so im taking supplements for that i also had an ekg done by my doctor which came back normal but he still referred me to a cardiologist to get a 24 hour blood pressure and ekg monitor test i had the same test done 4 years ago because one night i woke up feeling sick with a heart rate of 125 and blood pressure of 178110 since then ive noticed my blood pressure has been elevated but the top number never goes above 135 usually around 12070

im trying not to panic but i have to wait until july 11th for my appointment with the cardiologist and its really stressing me out

"3 strategies to cope with stress during life transitions going through a life transition can be stressful and overwhelming especially if you have multiple responsibilities for family work community and more balancing all these aspects while finding time for selfcare can be challenging  
  
to better manage your stress it is essential to improve your time management in terms of time allocation i encourage you to begin by addressing your distractions take a moment to reflect on the distractions that may be hindering your progress in life identify them and consider how you can let go of these distractions this becomes particularly crucial during times of significant life changes when your old routines or patterns have been disrupted prioritize by focusing on one task at a time determine what is most important at the moment and let go of less urgent matters  
  
the second key strategy is to establish a daily routine for selfcare even if it is as short as 30 20 or 10 minutes dedicate this time to activities that bring you peace and calm such as reading journaling nature walks yoga or meditation consistently follow this routine daily to recharge taking breaks and slowing down can enhance longterm efficiency and productivity  
  
stress is not solely a result of our actions it is also influenced by our thoughts overthinking can lead to stress and feeling overwhelmed one effective method to reduce stress is to reframe your thoughts and let go of overthinking practice mindfulness by focusing on the present moment avoiding worries about the future or dwelling on the past when you catch yourself contemplating the past or future pause become aware of those thoughts and redirect your focus to the present moment being mindful of everything around you and expressing gratitude  
  
stress can be a signal that it’s time to let go — let go of distractions unimportant matters and negative thoughts by releasing these attachments you create space for your mind to rest and quiet down breaking free from the captivity of stress letting go makes you feel lighter and more liberated

more than anything though it’s the cancer my husband is my best friend we’ve been together since i was 18  he was 19 i don’t know how i would do any of this without him i don’t want to see him suffer if he does have cancer it should be treatable but i just love him so much and don’t want him to have to go through this i’m trying not to get ahead of myself but his mom had the same type of cancer when she was younger than him

then i sent this “no idea who is constantly dragging chairs on floor at night but it’s obnoxious and here’s video to show what it sounds like” 

same person responded to me with 
“ why do you just assume that it’s me or her”
 had to change it to her for privacy reasons 

i responded to that with “why do people not give a fuck”
“not saying it’s you”

then she responds with “ because people live”
“and make noise while living”

and i responded to that with “oh yeah and sleeping doesn’t matter”

she responded to me with 
“it’s lowkey quieter during 2pm around here than 2am”",1
everyone hates me and i’ve been wronged by countless therapists i don’t even know what to do anymore… someone please respond i always go back to my old stressful ways and i’m constantly being attacked and hounded on for speaking my opinion…,1

heat anxiety is real being in the heat and sweating was maybe a nonissue when i was a kid or a teen but as a 55 year old adult with severe anxiety it mimics the effects of a panic or anxiety attack i balk at going out when its 97° and even a little bit humid i remember coming out of work one day when it was 105° and pretty humid i felt like i couldnt breathe another day i panicked and turned around to go get my car because my partners car just lost its ac it was superhumid just knowing that its so hot outside right now causes me anxiety it didnt help that the power blinked off for 5 min either ,1

"paranoid and anxious living alone i am a female college student who usually lives with 4 other girls in a house they all left for the summer and its just me here for a month i was really nervous about it already bc intruders are my biggest fear in the world and earlier this semester there was a guy who went to multiple girls houses around my area on multiple occasions trying to break in with a gun which was just the most terrifying thing to me the idaho murder case also doesnt help after those incidents we got door stoppers and similar things for our windows just to be extra safe i keep them on constantly when im home and always lock the door when i leave so theoretically it is pretty impossible to get into my house but i still get a little anxious about it especially walking up to my room on the 3rd floor and i have to go past so many doors and the door to the attic at the top of my stairs right next to my room even when im not home alone im paranoid someone got in and is waiting in there for me

last night i was trying to fall asleep at midnight and my phone buzzed i didnt want to check it bc i was trying to sleep but my anxiety said to check it bc what if its the ring app and someones at my front door

my soul left my body when i picked up my phone 

it gives you a preview of the camera on the notification i just saw someone really up close to my camera at my front door i immediately clicked it and was freaking out but was glad to see it was just a woman stealing my amazon package i forgot to pick up enjoy 5 toliet cleaner

it didnt help that earlier that day the door knob fell off on the inside of my door and i hadnt gotten around to fixing it yet so there was no stopper on the door

i couldnt sleep for hours even with my prescription sleeping pills first i distracted myself with youtube but when i went back to trying to sleep i kept trying to tell myself that no ones there and she just wanted the package and no ones coming back but my mind just kept replaying scenarios of someone breaking in and taking my foster dog i literally just got her and shes a tiny scared chihuahua so unfortunately not a guard dog and coming up and taking me or killing me or raping me or i dont even know and me just locked in the bathroom having a panic attack while on the phone with the police begging them to come when there was that serial break in attempter it took 30 mins for the police to come when one of the houses called them

fast forward to this afternoon i come home from my workout class through the back door and i immediately see the door knob on the front door was fixed i literally had a heart attack and started freaking out that someone was in my house i texted my roommates and one suggested it was our landlords handyman that maybe came by to replace a filter i checked the ring app and sure enough it was him thank you to my shitty landlord for the heads up and letting him just enter my home without my permission while i wasnt there

as it was getting later tonight i could feel myself getting more and more anxious having to walk up to the third floor two scares within 24 hours like i am not okay i made it upstairs and just wanted to immediately get into bed but i was like “no u can wash ur face u will be safe going into the bathroom” so i mustered up the courage to do my skincare in my bathroom i took my sleeping pill as soon as i could so i hopefully just knock out unfortunately it was my last one and i requested a refill from my psychiatrist thru cvs but they denied it no idea why bc i havent needed a refill on this med in so long bc i never usually take it im gonna call them tomorrow and ask about it

i know im going to start thinking of traumatic scenarios while im trying to sleep and i cant be up for hours tonight or any night this summer bc i have class super early in the morning also im already on anxiety meds im not having panic attacks over this but i need to sleep this isnt healthy 

i just constantly feel paranoid in my own house i cant wait to move out in a few months bc im moving to a gated apartment complex with security i dont think i’ll ever be able to live someone without some sort of gate which sounds so privileged but i absolutely hate this and just always feel so unsafe its not like i live in a bad neighborhood either sure its not a great part of the residential areas around my college but definitely not bad

im sorry this is so long does anyone have any advice for this",1
"stuck how do i grow out of this hey guys so i’m new to this group i’m 21 and married and in college 

right now i’m struggling with getting out of my comfort zone to go do something that would make me “me” and was hoping for some suggestions

the other day i went and tried to buy a motorcycle off facebook marketplace and when i did there were some things wrong with it and so i ended up not buying it on the drive home with my wife and pretty much broke down crying because i felt like i was really close to getting into a cool hobby that would keep me busy then continuing after when i got home i felt like maybe motorcycling wasn’t the thing for me and maybe so should play basketball or learn piano you get the idea

most days i play video games or watch tv but then i usually end the day feeling empty i know i should probably get into a hobby but when i think about doing it i feel really anxious and sick to my stomach and then make excuses and don’t do it i want to feel motivated to do things i just feel stuck

"im glad im still here i got in an argument with my husband last week on april 9th and it ended with no resolution at the time i had enough feeling like nobody will ever listen to me or take me seriously feeling like a burden to everyone i said some pretty hurtful things to him as did he to me he dropped me off at home and left for the store and i stomped upstairs angry and took a hot bath seeing if i could calm down it didnt calm me down i grabbed a bottle of 71 prozac pills and took 12 then got out of the bath got dressed and walked a mile down the road to this spot where my friend told me i wasnt worth being friends with anymore a few months ago taking more pills as i walked down the road until the bottle was empty with a can of sparkling water i cried a little bit but ultimately just sat by the water feeling numb thinking the pills probably wont kill me but even if they did i wouldnt care i just didnt want to be here anymore 

more and more financial stress adding up plus losing such a close friend can take its toll especially on top of already having dealt with mental illness since i was 13 the 9th seemed like a perfect day to end it all i had just seen the eclipse in totality the day before and went on a wonderful girls day so i was going out with fond memories i felt useless because i havent been able to hold down a job and never graduated and im constantly low on energy hardly being able to function on a daily basis feeling like i truly am impossible to love feeling like a horrible wife like he should just go and find someone else because he deserves better than this

i told my husband i loved him after he apologized for yelling but it was too late he called me and we went back out together to talk for a bit and eventually i had to tell him that there was 1420 milligrams of prozac in my body at the moment
i knew hed take me to the hospital forcibly if i didnt comply so i just let it happen i had to stay alone that night in a place i didnt recognize constantly having someone watch every move i make so they know im not trying to hurt myself i woke up to a sweet lady holding my hands telling me i have a lot to be thankful for and shes right i was okay and alive just dizzy i had calmed down and had a clear mind and all of a sudden i couldnt imagine being so angry that id try and kill myself i had never felt so angry and bitter

a couple days go by and im sent to an inpatient facility over a week later and im finally home far from feeling what i did a week later knowing why i did it but not knowing how i actually had the guts to do it thinking it was inevitable for me so i may as well do it now i guess

"some words of hope some words of hope 

speaking as someone who was here searching for answers dying around this same time last year and now in one of the best positions in my life 
have faith 

• change your mindset learn how to breathe meditate for practice oxygen flow to the brain is crucial 

• release tension in your body body scansacupuncture we carry tension in moments of stress that we might not be aware of releasing any muscles in your face is a good example they’re usually activated 

• positive thoughts  small wins
you are what you think you are you’re moved by what you think don’t trust your thoughts while depressed or anxious force yourself to recognize the good even when everything is rubbish 

do what you can give yourself grace don’t worry about what you can’t do try but don’t kill yourself you are not capable of functioning correctly when depressed you’re not an idiot you’re not that awkward you’re not incapable of socializing you’re not unpleasant to be around you’re none of that stuff your mind tries to tell you you just need a break from the pressures and stressors of the world  be kind to yourself 

• walk get outside physical activity is important fresh air is important food hygiene sleep are important get your nutrition value in develop good sleep habits i know a program for those interested please dm me if so 


• sleep is hella important to function correctly need to get it regularly and get help if you are not asap 

• do not consume alcohol it’s a coping mechanism that does more harm than good get to the root of the healing you need 

• get a psychiatrist make sure it works for you i’ve had many of doctors and therapists and psychiatrists over the past decade i’m black for the first time i’ve found a black therapist and psychiatrist that i could relate to and understood methe impact of how my cultural community responds to certain drugs and what to be mindful of it’s been a world of difference having someone who understands me and who i can trust instead of just being a guinea pig it’s helped me find better understanding and acceptance 

• acceptance is key
 i’m lonely 
 i’m tired 
 i’m out of shape or overweight 
 i’m not where i want to be in life 
 i’m broke in debt
 i’m scared 

all your feelings are valid and it’s all okay
you won’t be like that forever as long as you can accept that that’s all that matters everyone else has their own shit to figure out focus on you 

• stay positive and loving that’s cool
negative energy only harbors more negativity 
don’t let this shit change who you are 

hope this helps some of you out there
i can’t respond always but if you message me i’ll do my best to 

hang in there my ppls you got this

"i cant do this anymore i cant take this abuse from my parents anymore
my dad is bipolar and has adhd and is messed up in the head and my mom doesnt have any official diagnosis but shes just as messed up as my dad
they have been together for about 20 years and im 18 and for the past 18 ive seen my dad beat my mom more times than i can count
experienced them separating getting back together multiple times and been bullied by my dad who likes to make fun of me and the things i struggle with fx adhd and dyslexia and likes to call me retarded and says that ill never get a real job which he knows im really afraid will happen 
my mom has always been cold and emotionally distant ever since i was a kid
and now our relationship is absolutely shit 
ive seen time and time again how she has failed to be there for me fx when i needed to be comforted after my parents had a violent fight but she would start to yell and say im ruining the mood for my siblings
or the time where i was super suicidal and instead of helping she just pretended nothing was wrong to in her words keep some normality in the house 
or the time when she found out i was self harming and just said i wanted attention like i always do 
i have finally got a social worker after years of asking and she said i should move out which i first said no too but after years and years of this i have hit my absolute breaking point so i told her i wanted to move out asap but now it seems that the people in charge of helping me move out dont exactly know when they can make it possible
even though they made it sound like it could happen almost immediately
and now im so fucking done i feel like ive been failed to many times by the government and my own parents ive stood with all the pain all alone for my whole life and now i might be forced to endure a whole summer vacation with them and no i dont have any friends i can stay with either
so im just about done i cant take this hell anymore and i dont want to be alive if it just means this will be the rest of my life because just one day home is filled with screaming throwing plates my 2 year old brother having a tantrum and me crying until i have a migraine plus i have to go to school 
im so angry at the social worker people for not doing the absolute most to get me out of this house when its literally making me suicidal 
and im just absolutely hopeless i feel like ill never really be happy and get to enjoy my life 
its just one endless stream of pain for me so why even try at all at this point

"anxiety  depression  adhd a few months ago i was talking to my dr about symptoms that anxiety and depression share with adhd a lightbulb went off in her head and said “we may be going about this the wrong way” 

adhd was brought up and because ny is impossible to find a psychiatrist taking in new patients she said she’d ask her own to recommend and refer one for me she did but the shrink she recommended told me that they weren’t taking new patients fuck

regardless i was given 7 days worth of adderall the first day i took it life finally made sense my mind stopped going into a million directions i call it my web of thoughts bc everytime i thought of something it would branch into a completely different subject altogether i had the energy to finally get some tasks done that i was holding off for when my energy picked up never happened i just assumed it was the depression draining the life energy out of me 

 i am aware that adderall is addictive and i don’t want to be dependent on a medication due to the fact that i was there 10 yrs ago with opiates prescribed 

does anyone know of a fast acting adhd medication that can be taken as needed or am i gonna be forced to take these types of medications everyday 

 i was on a medication for depression that took 4–8 weeks to work and during those 48 weeks my mood swings were so intense that i was picking fights for no reason acting oddly and really i wasn’t my normal self 

again the question…is there a fast acting adhd med that can be taken as needed

"anyone else feel anxious about upcoming trips looking for tips hi everyone

do you ever feel anxious about an upcoming trip my friends and i are planning to visit a national park this summer its going to be super hot and far away from civilization were two months away from the trip and im already feeling anxious about a few things

1 im not super comfortable with these friends yet theyre super nice and supportive and they understand that i have anxiety but i just dont know them well enough to be fully comfortable what if i have an anxiety attack and have to worry about how i look in front of them
2 its going to be really hot and i know i wont feel good i prefer the cold and sometimes my anxiety is triggered by the heat
3 well be 6 hours away from civilization which means well be far from any sort of urgent medical help when my anxiety attacks come i can usually manage them but the thought of not being able to get medical help and feeling like im suffocating really freaks me out
4 we have to fly on a plane first which also makes me anxious because of the tight space the last time i flew i felt a bit anxious though i was able to use breathwork to calm down

has anyone else felt this way or dealt with similar anxieties before a trip do you have any tips or advice for managing these feelings

thanks in advance i just want to be excited for this trip and i feel like i cant right now because my anxiety is overriding everything ",1
depression gets worse when anxiety gets better  ive had anxiety for as long as i can remember so ive learned to live around it i didnt even know i had depression until i was put on an ssri prozac for anxiety and it improved my depressive symptoms instead leaving the anxiety as it was i figured it was better than nothing so ive mostly just stayed on prozac however at one point i was briefly put on paxil instead and it completely got rid of my anxiety  it was crazy unfortunately it made my depression severely worse so i stopped and went back to prozac which got my depression back under control now im doing intensive therapy emdr and its naturally healing my anxiety much of which is actually due to cptsd but with the removal of anxiety im once again finding myself more depressed even with the prozac its not up to concerning levels yet but i can tell its definitely getting worse and i dont know what to do ,1

"afraid to tell my therapist i relapsed 
hi all i’ve been struggling in general for the past few months with both my anxiety and depression because of side effects i was put on a different antidepressant but it’s done literally nothing for me other than cause more side effects so i stopped taking it one of the side effects i was having was violent thoughts and irritability which is taking its sweet time going away 

so i had a therapy session last week my angerirritability has only gotten slightly better since i stopped because of a stupid rule change i can now only get in to see my t once a month rather than every other week which has only made me more upset over the situation i also think it’s pointless and ineffective to only meet once a month i had a “meh” session where i felt like i wasn’t really all there and that we didn’t accomplish much i was just really having a bad off day i’m afraid to talk to my t about the scheduling issues—both because i don’t really think there’s much she can do about it and i also because i think i suck and don’t deserve it—how am i any different than her other clients that i assume also have trouble getting in 

 i called to schedule another appointment after session still can only get in three weeks later after hanging up i was even more upset upset at the situation upset for my inability to talk to my therapist about how much i hate not being able to get in upset at life i cried ugly cried i ended up biting my armshands several times until i bled 

i know i should talk to my t about this next time i see her but i’m ashamed of relapsing after being clean 7 years and i feel like a disappointment plus i don’t want to tell her not being able to get in to see her was part of the reason i got so upset  the worst thing about all this is that every night when i can’t sleep i sit and stew over not being able to get in and all i want to do is hurt myself i’ve written things down and given it to her before and i have written down the events and feelings about that day but i’m still so ashamed and afraid to give it to her next time i don’t know what to do ",1

i have general anxiety not many panic attacks but some rather chronic symptoms that come and stay for a prolonged period and then disappear – being lightheaded random prickling sensations slight burning on the skin tingly nose only upon touching it heart palpitations racing heart… the moment i get used to it and can reassure myself – ok this has happened before and you will be fine – then my body and mind think of a new symptom to present  

i have been working with a therapist for almost a year i am not sure there is much progress have seen several doctors cardiologist 3 neurologists gps and run lots of tests mris ekg velo test heart echo emg eeg evoked potentials testing head blood vessels blood tests – absolutely everything was fine except that my brain mri revealed a few tiny nonspecific foci at first i thought that was it – i am certainly having ms and that’s why my symptoms even though my doctors reassured me that minimal nonspecific lesions are nothing to be concerned about and that this does not indicate ms i went down the rabbit hole and kept myself in fear for the next so many months with googling and all “what if”

with every new symptom i feel like running back to docs and repeating the tests…

tried antidepressants but didn’t have a great experience taking herbal medication now st john’s worth magnesium vit b complex passion flower… trying to exercise meditate pray… keeping myself together for the family and work but at the end of the day i am so exhausted and thinking this will never change then i sleep which i thankfully do very well and during the night never feel any of these symptoms and another day with sometimes new misery starts

ive wondered if i have adhd at all multiple people have asked if i do in the past and i do have a habit of ggiving people conversational whiplash from time to time tho less so lately growing up i would usually forget things that i definitely shouldnt have i always thougght it was due to carelessness since my grandma told me that if i cared and applied myself i would remember it was always the most stupid stuff like some plannew rule that was set just an hour or so before ive realized now that it doesnt matter if i care or not i jsut forget things i recently forgot some important work that i needed to do on my research project that was somewhat time sensitive i made notes in the meeting with my mentor double checked verbally what to do as i left and then the moment i sat down at work after the meeting i didnt remember any of it until the end of the week like 5 days later i have an excel sheet i add all of my notes of what to do and appointments to but i forgot to add it to that because my memory jsut wiped by the time i would have added it

lately my memory issue has just become more pronounced and bad enough that its affecting many aspects of my life food goes to waste more my diet is horrible and while i used to be able to keep track of obligations in my head i no longer can without the excel sheet im so burned out too i barely ahve energy to do much organization in the new apartment with new roommate is not grat and i think its also part of why this has become more of an issue my normal way of organizing things is thrown off and i lack energy to do the amount of thought and reorganizing to basically redo the entire apartment in a way that i am used to

ive also had headsches more lately starting christmas break and for 3 months after i had chronic headaches mostly one sided flashes of pain close to my eyes and front areas of my head very localized and kind of like lines and spots of pain over the next month or so they began to fade away they have greatly gone down though and i am not having a lot of them now they are pretty much gone at this point ive been to my school clinic i think i at least mentioned it to them and their only advice was counselling i feel so paranopid i might have brain damage or something from stress

i got a potted plant small tiny diy cardboard thing with seeds from a school event recently i placed it on the shoe rack while i was taking off my shoes inside and then forgot about it for how ever many days until i saw dirt on the floor because my cat had knocked it over soome of the dirt had gotten on to some shoes on the top rack and was there 5 days my roomate roomie 2 brought it up as i was leaving thru the door to go somewhere day of 5 of dirt of shoes i said i would get it once i got back i forgot and today roommie 2 said the shoes are stained i feel so bad i cleaned them as well as i could my roommate roomie 1 with whom i have roomed a whilke and has commented on my stress alot in the past said i should look into a neurologist or something at this point i also talked some with roomie 1 about how i grew up in an environemnt that was constantly stressed and how the child i hated and felt estranged from was only so odd to me because i grew up only knowing myself under duress and now that i am not in that situation all the time i have since come to understand myself in a more normal context they brought up how stress stunts growth can have developmental affects which it absolutely can and i should really get this looked into

  
i feel so worried i feel a little unsure how to proceed i will at least get started with a counseling clinic near by aside from that idk what if i have brain damage what if im on a track to early onset dementia what else can i do now to mitigate future damage or ill health

i am trying to eat better and exercise more i used to be so healthy and athletic still had memory issues then but less so i just have so little energy now i feel so burned out and tired and hopeless i have the occasional day where my brain is utter mush and i can barely think part of me hardly cares that iut feels like im watching myself die in real time in death there is no thought and thus no worry so why should i care but in living right now my memory issues are negatively impacting those around me and i feel like im almost always hung over i hate this i want to fix  this but i am so busy all the time and have so little energy i feel like half my energy everyday is spent on just the moment of waking up and being made to be concious and lving im so tired

editi did also offer to repkace the shoes if need be and have cleaned them as i could my glasses and vision arent great so its a little hard to see if they have a fiant stain atill",1

"repeated gagging from stress hi guys 

thought id post here to see if anyone has any tips or have gone through this same thing 
for context i 25f do struggle viciously with my mental health and i take various medications for that but none have been changed in the most recent time 

i am however having a really stressful time with family issues and facing a housing issue  i have found myself in an unexpected situation where i need to find housing in the relatively close future however i am struggling financially aswell and trying to get this sorted is taking it out of me because im not sure what im going to do or where im going to be living these are ongoing issues which have really taken a toll on my already struggling self 

i have recently started having what i would call fits of gagging where out of nowhere i would suddenly start to gagretch and im finding it difficult to stop this has been happening more and more regularly and even in public i generally dont actually vomit but have the feeling of sickness then after for a long while side note i am 100 not pregnant this is why i am assuming its stress related

i sometimes take motillium to help with the nausea however i dont want to end up in a cycle of taking this and its also an expense that i could do without right now 

im wondering has anyone had the same happen if so have you got any tips to help stop or things to ease this feeling unfortunately i cant eliminate the source of my stress and im trying my best  but this gagging is not helping

if you got this far thank you reading tho ",1

"at my lowest point ever and really could just use some support my anxiety has genuinely ruined my life and the depression isnt helping i want to explain the situation im in and just get it off my chest so here we go

i have pretty severe anxiety and developed agoraphobia over the past 3 years i also have depression generalized anxiety disorder ptsd and probably other conditions i stopped being able to work because of my mental illnesses and its genuinely ruined my entire life i kept trying to work but then genuinely couldnt keep a job because i was either too depressed to get out of bed or too anxious to leave my house as my agoraphobia got worse i got very isolated and developed some disordered eating habits and having lockdown didnt help me either i found that when lockdown ended i couldnt go out the door without feeling sick 

the most stressful part is that i cant survive like this not asking for money or anything i just really need to vent about this part because its killing me i havent been able to keep a job so now my savings are completely emptied im now on section 8 so i can stay housed i qualify for food stamps but kept getting rejected because i couldnt physically get to the office to turn in documents  or because they werent sending me the right documents  so ive been really hungry for months and trying to get myself to food banks but with agoraphobia thats not always possible although i do try very hard and make it sometimes  i keep trying desperately to find ways to help myself and nothing turns out ive been rejected for disability 5 or 6 times i try to sell things online and go an entire year without selling anything ive tried selling everything i have actually custom artwork clothing jewelry graphic design commissions you name it nothing works im trying very hard to just stick it out through this situation but it gets so hard when nothing seems to make an impact

things are getting worse and worse i never thought it would actually get to the point where i skip meals because i dont have the money to get 3 meals a day but thats where im at now right now im 100 in the negative and i need just 30 to pay this insurance for my apartment which is my responsibility to pay or i get evicted and i genuinely dont think im going to be able to find the money for that its really possible i might become homeless and i dont know what the hell im going to do because theres just so much i cant do

and its fucking heartbreaking i didnt expect living on my own to be perfect but i at least expected to survive i feel like im not going to even survive at this rate every day is hellish and i dont know how im going to get out of this situation

also i dont really have anybody in my life who can support me im a foster child who grew out of the system so i dont have any family and ive slowly lost all my friends because of the way the agoraphobia isolated me dealing with all of this on my own and the only other human being i see regularly is my therapist its very lonely every night there is no one out there who cares if i cry myself to sleep if i do end up homeless no one will care

nevermind the potential dangers im in  for fucks safe i just want to feel safe not even happy anymore just safe my life has taken some shitty turns but this is genuinely the worst its ever been and i really cant see how its ever going to get better 

has anybody else ever had their depressionanxiety completely ruin their life like this is it even possible to recover from something like this",1
"how to get over pill anxiety long story short my aunt gave me one at 8 and at the time i didnt know how to swallow them so i literally choked and have not been able to take them properly since i dont know why she thought giving an 8 year old a large vitamin pill was a good idea but whatever

ive been on sertralinezoloft for months now and i thought id have gotten over it by now but the fear is still as intense as when i first started 50mg

im on 100mg now and im just so tired of being so extremely anxious over taking it i usually just end up letting it dissolve in my mouth and swallowing when i feel its small enough which is a terrible idea btw if uve taken zoloft youd know how the coating numbs and kinda burns when you take it the wrong way

i just thought after a while my anxiety would lessen upon realising that its okay and safe to take and dont get me wrong i was getting used to it and was cutting down the dissolving time swallowing it almost normally until one day it went down wrong my fear came back full force 

also that was with 50mg so the 100mg just feels impossible

should i just give up and move to liquid solution im so tired i also just feel its so so stupid like its sooo small why do i struggle so bad i hate it so much

"constant vertigo headache dizzyness and clumsiness lots of physical symptoms all day long yet not feeling so anxious all the time but symptoms persist and unable to cope with everyday life tips anyone gotten help from beta blockers to physical symptoms hi

im a male and around 25 years old thanks to 2 and half year long tiredness heavy feeling brain fog weakness tremor visual snow muscle twitches and feeling of unsteadinessvertigo i havent been able to work or progress in my studies my problems and symptoms started to be constant after covid infection two and half years ago but they appeared at high stress situations already year before the covid infection i have problems with sleeping for months too i wake up usually too early and feel really really sick and shaky immediately after waking up

no medical cause has been found despite lot of testing and i finally sought mental health help myself despite feeling its a taboo for a male to do that i dont myself really feel that im so anxious all the time and the symptoms stay when im not feeling anxious but what can they be then if no other cause has been found after so diligent testing there are lot of stressful factors in my life though but i wont open up about them here little over month ago agomelatine medication for anxietydepression was started however the following two weeks from starting the medication my originally slight vertigo steadily worsened and was getting so strong that i stopped taking the meds at two and half weeks

now two and half weeks later the worsened vertigo still persists my doctor says its not caused by the medication anymore nor after simple tests any cause for vertigo was found

i have a constant feeling like someone tries to push my head to some constantly alternating direction or like im onboard a swaying boat it gets worse when i go for a jog or just move around the vertigo also causes nausea my neck to feel stiff and constant moderate headache sometimes when headache and vertigo is really bad i feel like speaking is really hard but not slurred

can anxiety cause such vertigo now that the symptoms have lasted for two years i often do fear that i have some severe disease so i guess im at least now starting to get really anxious when nothing seems to help or cause havent been found feelings of hopelessnes also start to creep since even the anxiety medication didnt work

past two weeks have been hell the constant vertigo never eases and i cannot concentrate on anything i just lie mostly at bed but even there i feel the vertigo and nausea i feel i look so drunken and clumsy with my vertigo headache and brainfog that i fear that people think im a drunkard

there are lot of posts about anxiety and vertigo some quite recent too but i would like to hear experiences about such constant vertigo and physical symptoms also i want to hear whether people have gotten help from beta blockers or some other medication i could suggest to my doctor to prescribe beta blocker along with the agomelatine or other antidepressant",1

i feel like im at my lowest since last winter where i hospitalized myself and had ect’s done my head still hurts from those i feel like my past trauma is catching up with me i keep reliving the memories the anxiety the worry the stress

ive seen hundreds of yt videos on mental health and self improvement like healthy gamer andrew huberman jordan peterson david goggins jocko tony robbins etc

people always say go to church excercise and eat healthy i feel like that’s practically been my motto for years but it seemed more beneficial when i was younger but now it just seems like routine i’m running out of hope buf ill keep praying for change maybe i’ll finally get a break to be at least a little happy to feel like i achieved something in this life",1

i f24 had the opportunity to move out into an apartment and live alone as well as with a roommate when i was 21 and i was generally doing pretty well in the mental health department aside from getting made redundant from my job i decided to move back home after well over a year of staying there because 1 it would help me save money and 2 my mum finally got my dad to move out which made me think i would feel some sense of safety and security 

his departure from the household has been incredibly traumatic and draining for me it wasn’t as civil as extended family members would have probably liked it to be which has resulted in myself feeling isolated from the family because some of them are mad at how my brother and i spoke to our dad after he left but years of dealing with his narcissism and gambling addiction has broken me from pressuring me into buying him cigarettes every time my mum told him to pick me up from the train station after a shift to covering for his debts… coincidentally i now struggle with a cigarettenicotine addiction and have an unhealthy relationship with money he would regularly take my grandmother’s pensioner benefits and have me spot him the money until he could pay me back months later or not pay me back at all ‍♀️ there’s also the shame and guilt i’ve had to carry from my teenage years after my cousin disclosed how my dad had sent her mum my mum’s sister unsolicited dick pics and asked my cousin inappropriate sexual questions about her and her boyfriend’s relationship so on top of my dad being a complete dipshit of a father to his kids and terrible husband to his wife i have to add ‘a cheating  creepy weirdo’ to the list this was probably one of the major points in my life for my psychologist diagnosing me with clinical depression  suicidal ideation and gad 

the breaking point which led to my parents finally splitting was when he asked me for 25000 and at this point i had just lost my job and was still living at the apartment  we werent even speaking much for him to know i was made redundant nor did he care when i told him why i couldnt fork out that much money for him after confiding in my brother it led to him having a mental breakdown while intoxicated after a wedding and i took it as an opportunity to show our mum what hell we’ve been going through years of arguing with our parents to just get a divorce because we were sick of their constant fighting and it finally comes to an end once my mum finds my brother covered in vomit yelling and crying to the entire world that he hates his dad

my dad has been nothing but a pain in my arse like a persistent haemorrhoid that just doesn’t go away not once has this man ever financially contributed to any of his children’s expenses or put in the effort to have any relationship with his children  a literal inhouse deadbeat days after leaving he’s hassling my younger brother to go out and look for a car that he can pay for him as a gift saying that he’s got tens of thousands of dollars in the bank for it… not even two weeks later he’s asking me for money again

moving on from that we have all gone nocontact with him after my brother and i sent scathing messagescalls telling him to back off when he showed up unannounced to the house while we were holding our other aunty’s funeral prayer thing and found out that he had talked smack about our mum to her older relatives to this day my uncle won’t even greet me let alone talk to me at family gatherings or events because of this

these last few years and months for me have been full of traumabonding with my brothers and mum i cannot confirm if this has been helpful at all in my healing or theirs we have shared how some of us experience dreams or thoughts which clearly are indicators of some fucked up anxiety such as dad coming to attack or kill us mutual fear shared between myself and my mum probably because i have seen firsthand how physically aggressive violent and abusive he used to be towards my mum dad dying and how we’re all going to have a nervous breakdown dealing with his funeral  his side of the family or my own personal thought him getting involved with loan sharks or something and i get roped into the mess sometimes i feel guilty because i think i stripped my brothers and i of a dad even though he was not a great one at all which makes no sense as to why i’m feeling this it’s like i’m grieving for the dad we never got to have i occasionally feel the urge to check on his facebook and see that all he does is post videos of himself drinking smoking and singing karaoke with various descriptions basically implying that he’s sad miserable hating on god because of how his life has turned out and how he did nothing wrong etc etc

with the added quarter life crisis i’m dealing with in regards to career i haven’t worked for a few months now since my last job after having an anxiety attack by myself in the warehouse trying to finish all my tasks while everyone else was on holiday 

i’m now constantly feeling like i’m in a flight or flight mode there’s literally no fight mode left in the depths of my soul that i can reach for i feel like i’m at my lowest mentally and physically and have no motivation to look after myself or my wellbeing and i’m ready to shave my hair off because i get constant matted hair from bed rotting i have this deeprooted fear and innerhate that i’ll turn out exactly like my dad because we share a lot of personality traits like father like daughter trauma and every time i think about it i get hella depressed and my mind immediately starts thinking of ways i can yeet myself off the face of this earth the thought of having children can’t even cross my mind in any positive way because i’m terrified of becoming a parent like my dad with our short fuse these last few days has been incredibly hard for me because my mum has been yelling at me to basically get my shit together and my body is constantly trembling because her screaming is sporadic and it’s the same manner in which she would yell at my dad throughout my entire life im like reenforcing in my head that i am just like my dad it’s welldeserved at this point because i really do feel like a bum someone was bound to call me out on it and i do need to get a grip of myself but my anxiety is through the roof

i have come to a realisation today that my mental health has only ever declined and then stayed stagnant when i am in this house it is full of reminders of my childhood and earlyadult trauma and it’s as if i feel compelled to not want to get better and just die i feel like i have reverted back to my old ways of being depressed like i am my 16 year old self again i am frozen all the time because if i off myself or move away i don’t know if i can be the support person that i want to be for my brothers especially my younger brother i know that i need to support myself first so that i can support my brothers but if i stay here i am struggling to see any light in getting better i already have a habit of avoiding social interactions with my friends when i’m going through it and i’m currently going on that 3 month mark of not talking to anyone except for people under the same roof and i’m a little scared of how i’ll be if i move out i don’t want to have to go on fluoxetine again because that emotional numbness was crazy but i do plan on going to see a psychologist again as talking through my thoughts does help

i’m just curious if anyone has had any similar experiences in terms of struggling to live at a place that harbours memories of trauma or with people who share the same trauma what did you guys do",1

"bad experience with weed led to mental health issues i want to share my story in hopes of providing comfort to others and also to get some opinions and comfort in knowing i’m not alone a little over a month ago may 2024 i hit a very high thc dab pen once and got really high previous to this i didn’t smoke i hadn’t smoked since high school i don’t know why i suddenly thought i would enjoy it or have a good experience i didn’t experience an actual panic attack during the high but i did feel scared i was at a large music festival and it was very loud and just an overwhelming environment luckily i had my best friend with me who sat with me the whole time and actually kept me calm and comfortable after the festival i got sick which i took nyquil for i had a very scary experience with this including some hallucinations and just feeling terrible fast forward to twoish weeks after this i had my first full blown panic attack in years i was diagnosed with gad when i was 11 years old but never experienced any severe panic after this panic attack i felt completely disassociated and having some pretty bad derealization during this i believe i got into my own head and fully convinced myself i was going crazy i was so scared that i was going into psychosis or i was developing schizophrenia despite not having any symptoms that directly correlated to either of these disorders i asked my boyfriend if every single sound i heard was real and was constantly looking around making sure everything seemed normal the panic attacks got bad again and i ended up calling 911 and was taken to the hospital they gave me ativan to calm me down and assured me that i wasn’t having a psychotic break and that i was experiencing some really bad anxiety after getting in my own head they represcribed me zoloft i had been on this previously for depression from 20202023 
i’ve been on the zoloft for a week now and take ativan if needed but only have had to take it twice in the two weeks since my hospitalization i’ve also started going back to therapy in hopes that it will help as well i fully believe that the bad high mixed with how in my head i was made me develop some severe health anxiety i’m now absolutely terrified of any substance and ever feeling intoxicated in any way ever again my therapist believes the reason i went into the state of disassociation and derealization was my brains way of protecting me 
this whole experience has been utterly awful and so terrifying i still have the fears that i’m actually going crazy and that something is terribly wrong with me but i’m slowly trying to convince myself that i am actually okay and that everything will get better 
has anyone else ever gone through this any advice

"mom startled me awake 4 hours ago and i haven’t been able to regulate or stop crying hi everyone

i guess im looking for a virtual hug some advice on how to handle this with mom and any insights about whats happening mentally andor physically before we jump in i want you all to know that im seeing a psychologist weekly and trying diet and supplements before medspsychiatrist these are genuinely working and im in no danger of selfharm

tldr mom barged into my room yelling for me this morning and the emotions it triggered have been overwhelming i havent been able to regulate my emotions while i wanted to cry earlier but couldnt once i started i havent been able to stop i dont understand these feelings and their connection to being startled awake

im a 29yearold woman whos been battling depression and anxiety on and off since around 20152016 my worst episode yet started in november 2022 and while i havent fully recovered im doing much better

some context my family mom dad sister 27 and sister 23 and i love each other dearly and generally have a great relationship however theyve all struggled to show up for me even with specific feedback i particularly struggle with feeling unseen unconsidered and unsupported when i vent to them seeking validation and understanding im often met with dismissive phrases like i wouldnt focus on that or its not that big of a deal this makes me feel lonelier and like im cursed with big feelings theres also a toxic trait where negative emotions are shunned making me feel like theres no safe space for me

were currently traveling in costa rica an experience that should be amazing but ive found myself wanting to cry daily or actually crying i started using cannabis a little over a year ago because it helped me process emotions and feel more in control by making them less overwhelming it also helped keep suicidal thoughts at bay however since its illegal here and my youngest sister pestered me about not bringing my vape pen i havent smoked since last friday before traveling its been a difficult adjustment to say the least

now on to the situation that prompted this post this morning howler monkeys were right outside our balcony eating leaves off a tree they were so close i could have touched them we know its a big nono so we didnt one of them even had its baby on its chest my mom got very excited and rushed into my room yelling my name startling me awake last night i specifically asked my family not to wake me up unless i was in danger of missing breakfast ive had insomnia all week not being able to fall asleep before 1130 pm most nights and waking up at 67 am for tours and hikes you can imagine my sleep deprivation

my immediate reaction was intense anger a constant theme during this depression episode i cant explain it any other way than feeling like i cant fit inside my own body then came an overwhelming need to cry but i couldnt at first now two hours later i cant stop crying at the beginning of the crying spell im pretty sure i was having a panic attack

im so incredibly tired of dealing with such intense emotions its exhausting i constantly think i dont want to do this anymore any of this it feels like people always promised life would be amazing and i cant remember the last time i was genuinely happy i feel like life is targeting me and that the universe has decided i dont get to be happy its just my luck

does anyone know why being startled awake has been so difficult for me im so tired and tense even breathing hurts sorry for such a long post but if you read this far know that i am incredibly greatful",1
"this weird feeling in my chest am neither diagnosed or am seeing a therapist but i think sometimes we just know when somethings wrongbut lately i get this uncomfortable feeling deep in my chest that would soon send me into a spiral of unwanted thoughts and overthought thoughts i just keep overthinking and worrying over every single problem and issue in my life rn its work and my financial situation then it would be about my friendships or if i think my family hates me it disrupts my sleep worsens at night but is still very present in the day 

idk what to do some days its tolerable i just distract myself until i fall asleep or something else comes onto my plate on nights where its really bad i cannot sleep i cannot even look at my phone i take medicine to knock me out anything i could get my hands on like motion sickness pills else id start to breakdown and i cannot breathe and the feeling in my chest becomes actually painful harming myself used to be an option but i stopped cutting though now im resorting to other methods like skin picking not the best but somehow it serves enough as a distraction 

i know the best case is to see a therapist but i have neither the time i work more than 40h a week on an interns low pay my family is unsupportive and therapy is not subsidised all i can do it go to reddit or google

"artists here how do you come in terms with being a small artist and never being able to get past that i cant find the right sub for this except the art sub wouldnt allow this post

i dont want to be famous either but it would be nice to be able get some comments and rtslikes on my twitter account with my art in it i cant post every single day due to my mental health and severe burn out which burnout has been ongoing for a few years now and still wont get better despite me drawing little by little as time passes i know it might be my mental health but i struggle to even focus and sit still on sketching can barely trust the process ive had perfectionism since my whole life and it never ever goes away and i struggle to even keep up with my art even if its something i really love to draw

i tried doing raffles and requests still barely went anywhere i tried to even use a few hashtags too still notbing my life feels completely stangant and futile there are so many things outside of my control such as needing a little help filling a job application due to my disability and my mother has little to no time to help me because of her owed stuff like bills and other adulting stuff i am unable to get a job at this time rate but i want to able to figure out a way to make money to be able buy my own stuff because i know my mom wont

trying to find interactions on social media is finding a needle in a haystack and let alone even finding one friend from there its impossible for me do i just have shit luck how do you accept having always shitty luck in your life

how do you come in terms never being able to find friends other than few and also discord servers online because of how things are currently online and how shitty the algorithm it greatly reduced my chances of ever building myself up on twitter

i tried to post even nonart stuff daily i tried to sell commissions briefly till i had to refund one client on discord and had to apologize to them because i didnt finish the comm in a timely matter and i already had a downward spiral because i wasnt even allowed to even just show wips and keep my own pace thanks to inflation and getting less clients my moviation for doing ever any commissions has completely dropped for me

what happened to me

is there something wrong with me

i dont get excited im not excitable really i get told that something is happening and i dont dread it or worry either im just there 

i dont smile i dont frown or scowl either people say i look upset im not upset im also not the smiley type


i dont like seeing family when i do i just feel like im holding my breath its at the point where my mom would rather i not come to events i dont cause trouble but would also rather not be there 

i dont like seeing friends or the people who are supposed to be friends by extension of my wife i saw some the other weekend and couldnt stop thinking about everything i was falling behind at home then this week her new job has some mandatory fun next weekend and im still exhausted from seeing people last month i said no thanks she said she would take our daughter to the event without me i said please do

my work had a luncheon ie mandatory fun im a  teacher and it was the last event before summer we had to come in just for this mandatory fun and all i want is to be out of there the whole time i wondered how and when i could get out i thought maybe if i fall and jerk my head the mandatory nonsense would be over
a teacher and it was the last event before summer  

i dont think im depressed

i used to work out a ton but then i tore my achilles a second time its been a rough recovery 

i used to play video games as a me time then my wife got pregnant and we had to move to a new house then we had a daughter i love my daughter but i havent played video games since when i moved

theres constant work to do in this house and if i let the grass grow too much itll be more of a pain to mow two weekends in a row it rained and when i finally mowed it was way too long i also killed a baby bird by accident since i couldnt see it in the high grass i dont want that to happen again

my hvac unit went out in march replacing it was 30g i know a few weeks later my wifes junker car required 2k to fix and it seemed more reasonable to finally get a car that would help the baby suddenly two more payments a month 
then two weeks later she got a good review on tuesday and was fired friday 

it took two months for her to get a new job in the meantime i was picking up all kinds of side gigs and tutoring hours 
i was working 67 days a week

"my personal experience with psychiatric medications after 3 months of taking sertraline 100mg once a day and 10mg of buspirone twice a dayprescribed by psychiatrist i am ready to share my experience with you especially with those who judged me for not visiting a psychiatrist in the first week i did not notice any difference no sideeffects and no improvements after week one the nightmare began brain fog i had concentration judgement and decisionmaking impairment i couldn’t even concentrate on a simple topic like listening to news on the radio i couldn’t make a decision between two basic options like should i read a book now or watch tv headache feeling a mixed feeling between headache and lightheadedness constipation passing bricks instead of oh you know normal things excessive tiredness and daytime sleepiness i felt extreme fatigue all the time day and night i couldn’t complete a simple task i couldn’t even do my daily personal tasks appropriately weight gain and sweets craving i was hungry all the time and i wanted nothing but sweets specifically chocolate donuts i gained 6 kilograms of extra weight sounds so nice and lifegiving i don’t think so agitation what is your reaction if someone accidentally kicked your leg any sane person would react “no problem ma’amsir” but when you take these pills you will react so strongly to such minor issues that you will immediately regret your nasty reaction muscle fatigue muscle rigidity i had pain and spasm in my shoulders and neck area no matter what position i was in
warning in the following i will say things that psychiatrists wont like but these are truth so if you are a psychatrist i recommend you to dont read this if you dont want to get hurt
taking into account the things i said above i came to the conclusion that i became unhappy and hated myself because these characteristics that these pills had imposed on me were completely in conflict with my personality characteristics which was an active and lively person and this personality conflict made me hate myself because i had a desire to do an activity efficiently but these problems caused by the pills prevented me from reaching my goal until one day i decided to throw this garbages that the psychiatrists call them medication into the trash bin and i stopped using them after almost a week of stopping the drugs i returned to my normal state and was freed from that painful nightmare and finally i believed in my own opinion that psychiatry is not a science but a fraud pharmaceutical companies produce poisons under the name of medicine and fraudsters under the name of psychiatrists are responsible for distributing these poisons this is an unethical business the doctor profits from the money the patient pays for the visit and the pharmaceutical company profits from the sale of its poisons when you visit a psychiatrist you have one or two problems that you want to solve but by giving you these poisons the psychiatrist increases your pain and suffering so that you have to go to him again and pay and instead he prescribes new poisons for you that double your problems and you go to him again until you realize that you have become dependent on him and his drugs yes you are the credit card that psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies are constantly draining it",1

"we have a switch inside our physical body to counteract stress it goes unnoticed is unknowingly activated daily by most for other reasons  


  
what does inspiring movie scenes songs that move us or just human interaction with loved ones all have in common they activate this powerful blissful energy inside of us that is commonly known as frisson euphoria prana qi and can be most easily felt within us when we experience chillsgoosebumps from positive eventsstimuli  


  
this soothing energy can be learned to be activated as you please without any outside stimuli just the simple intention of experiencing it so imagine how helpful it can be when faced with unwanted stressanxiety you can even feel it over your whole body flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration  


  
this has been documented many years ago in the eastern part of the world as they discovered that it can be made to flow through the body via channels coined as meridians or nadis that encompass the entire human body  


  
it has been researched and documented under many names like bioelectricity life force prana chi qi orgone rapture tension aura euphoria ecstasy mana vayus asmr nen intent tummo odic force kriyas pitī frisson ruah spiritual energy secret fire the tingles ondemand quickening voluntary piloerection aether chills spiritual chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help   


  
why is this important too many sources point us to outside substances to manage stress as if the human body wasnt designed to be able to rely on itself for its own internal problems  


  
now for some of you that say that stress is good should consider that there are two types of stress and oxidative stress has been linked to several neurological diseases ie parkinsons disease alzheimers disease ad amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als multiple sclerosis depression and memory loss   


  
if you are interested in using your frisson switch here are three written tutorials going more indepth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from

"snris  erectile dysfunction hello i’m going to try and be verbose here end explain my situation  hopefully someone in a similar situation or circumstance can provide some guidance please go easy on me i’ve been trying to figure this out 

i’m 20m and i’ve been taking pristiq desvenlafaxine for almost exactly 2 years now 

for a while now i’ve noticed my libido expected go down but what was unexpected is difficulties with my member don’t get me wrong i can still get it up but it’s significantly delayed i don’t get “turned on” as easily like there’s an overall lack of blood flow  deprioritization to that area it doesn’t seem as hard as it was prior to being on this medication 

couple things worth noting i have gad  panic disorder  agoraphobia i went from being a pretty respected high school athlete with a close group of friends to watching them all go away to college as i slowly became a husk of the person i was 

i want to mention it is not like my libido is dead… i’m still a post pubescent barely adolescent male i’m seeking counsel from those who have been or are in a similar place 

so far the ultimatum seems to be 

 stay on the medication  continue to experience this issue pray that it’s non permanent this also concerns me because i’ve read some literature about postssrisnri erectile dysfunction 

 wean off the medication  potentially see both my libido  member return to their original status while sacrificing my mental health 

honestly as a young guy who doesn’t get a ton of play due to being agoraphobic i have a therapist and have been don’t fantastic with exposures and getting out lately so that may change  has me considering how to get myself in working order it’d be embarrassing to have sex  be flaccid 

thanks

"stress help needed  wound up  could really use some tipstricks 

when i get wound up from stress it’s difficult for me to complete any other tasks for the day i have things i know need to be done but something perhaps unrelated will occur that is stressful and i am in paralysis 

for example i’m owed roughly 2k from clients i’m a freelancer i have been on their ass for roughly 3 weeks on paying me they told me four days ago i’d be paid in two days well i’m still not paid 

this scenario has got me wound up so tight in stress that i cannot make myself do my tasks for the day i tried going to the pool doing other activities doom scrolling and i’m just sick 

i need any advice on how to get myself out of this tight ball if i got paid that would do the trick but i’ve got 60 to my name and it’s really making me physically ill knowing i’m owed enough money to bring me relief but my client has not paid 

i’ll try anything i’m flying tomorrow and i’ve got to do some stuff tonight to prepare traveling while in this position is making it worse i’ve considered cancelling but i’ve paid for everything up to this point no refunds if i do cancel 

i’m crawling out of my skin with anxiety and stress my goal right now is to get through my final tasks for the day please send any ideas

"anxiety  stress 247 everyday i am waking up with some sort of issue there is always something going on even when im doing perfectly fine i have been smoking weed since 13 years old now 18 and less than a week sober and things have been difficult its not just the weed

life in general is difficult natural stressors like people things not wanting to go your way and negative thoughts i smoked all of it away to be suppressed however even high i still felt the exact same waking up it’d be my first thought prior to eating i would partake anything that involved to be done easily sober i would just ignore it and let my mind follow through like it’s an infected mindset 

i feel like i couldn’t breathe high and even sober it’s that way too this constant stomach tension an uneasy feeling and with the difficulty breathing is making life unlivable it’s easy to convince i have something i don’t know about i can’t take anyone’s advice because i am so selfish about myself like i know everything but i seriously don’t i feel like some days my body will just give out because it can’t handle it for too long i seriously don’t know it is horrible anxiety i want to believe it is years of stress and not doing anything has really caught up to me and i hate this so much waking up with something even after talking is annoying all the sadness turned into anger i just yell at people it’s self sabotage and i don’t know how to get out of the mindset i placed myself in

"your higher self communicates to you through intuition gut feelings dreams synchronicities and goosebumps it knows your future and all possible combinations of it  


  
whatever choice you make your higher self knows the series of events after that and if you wish to get to a certain point in your life in the future it knows how to get there exactly step by step  


  
a big reason why you experience noninstantaneous gratification of your wishes is that you may not be listening to your higher self  


  
that delay is caused by differences between what your egoyour personality here on earthchooses and what your higher self will let you know to do or not to do  


  
if you want to be more aware intuitive creative instead of reactive and detached from situations that wont bring you closer to your goals  


  
i made this youtube video in hopes to help you learn how to recognize when your higher self is warning you through your intuition confirm through goosebumps you are on the right path and trust your higher self

one day i only slept for 2 hours yet went clubbing the night after because i had so much energy that has never happened

after the two weeks i became overstimulated at work and felt very self destructive anxious then so depressed and exhausted that i couldnt sit up and had to take two days off

is it just burn out maybe i should have socialised less despite really wanting to but i dont like ignoring my desires

is this something anyone else has had i just want to understand how it works and if i can do anything to manage it better

not showering for days not really minding not having the reason eating feels strange much of the time no reason to do it i should take a walk i should eat a salad i should do a million other things growing on the list of real issues the shoulds are building a nest inside my head it grows bigger and i feel smaller

the reason is me you should be the reason thats what we hear it isnt enough

how are you hope youre enjoying the sun today make time for selfcare gotta run i have a dinner to go to need to pick up the kids family is coming over were doing our thing

how am i i am in bed until 2 pm moved to the couch by 3 doing the same thing ive been doing if i told you would it matter

would you come over hold my hand play music could we eat together

i already know the answer ive heard depression is a time for deep rest here i am doing the thing i feel invisible low exhausted they say it gets better who are they when

depression is a thief and a murderer it is like dying while you watch yourself inside a terrarium and the world keeps going your whole small life so big to you is not much of anything really

if i knew how to end this i would have an answer if isolation could be fixed with a pill wouldnt that be something everything is backward and i am just trying to sleep through it

my boss is a nightmare good afternoon to whoever sees this my boss continues to come to work being mean and hasty i have no idea why she brings her personal issues to work and now all she does is get mad at me sometimes and when i was working with hr to get my pay fixed seemed like she started treating me differently and fucking always changing my schedule i have told her i need thursdays off and she has been scheduling me that day my moms bday was coming this thursday and she knew and i let her know how excited i was about it and she ended up scheduling me that day our other manager quit recently she ended up just dumping all his work on me when i said i can’t keep up she mentioned to me that i made this company out to be a bad company when they really aren’t and when i told her i don’t appreciate her putting words in my mouth all i was doing was getting clarification on my pay she continues to be bipolar and takes it sometimes out on the team what do you guys do in this situation hr said let me do something but they don’t they are all friends with her i live on site here and they don’t accept partial payments for rent but she does it every month it’s unfair as housing laws and lease agreements say not to do that also not sure about this part but i have a fear of telling her i won’t be here thursday since my mom’s bday is very important to me,1
it’s over i believe now that there is truly no hope for humankind all the good people have been killed by the bad ones and the news promotes that just to prove how horrible we are everything i read and see in today’s society proves that mankind especially those in power are all bullies it’s my own experiences with bullies that made me realize that i personally see no point in continuing on yes i have issues that are called mental illness because that truly is how i see mankind nowadays ,1

"anxiety at home  my partner and i live with a “friend” who owns a house that’s too large for just one person  we live on the top floor and she lives downstairs  we share a kitchen  the yard  

she’s a lot of emotional work for me and has some pretty presumptuous expectations of our time and attention possibly because she’s created a life in which she has no other friends  we’ve been living together for 18 months and that is unlikely to change  she’s not a
monster  she’s just emotionally immature and somewhat selfish  

she needs a lot of support to manage her anxiety but not in an honest and selfaware way she thinks that she has no mental health issues  i have my hands full with my own issues  i  go to therapy  i  take dbt classes  i  take my meds regularly  but she’s making it tough on me  or actually i’m choosing to let her impact me negatively  with her constant demands for attention and soothing  

i need some honest fair advice about how to be both supportive but firm with her about boundaries and learning to selfsoothe  i‘ve already increased my meds since we moved in and i’m thinking of asking for a prn to handle the worst days because she’s really having an impact on me  ",1

"i stopped taking zoloft and now i’m having the worst nightmares i’ve ever had in my life i weaned off slowly maybe 3 months ago now and had zero issues i was on it for over a decade

the reason i weaned off is because it started making me sick after i got on lamictal for epilepsy which is apparently also used for depression and bipolar my neuro said it might help overall with my mood and the plan was to eventually get off zoloft anyway because we wanted to see if it was still even necessary im also on buspar because keppra makes you want to die but i don’t think it does much for me

long story short i think it’s necessary 

the first month after being fully weaned off  no issues

the second month i started to have vivid dreams i’ve never been much of a dreamer or at least i never remember them if i do these dreams felt so real that the feelings would carry into my waking world for the rest of the day they weren’t really bad just extremely intense and random i’d have moments of “shit did that really happen or not”

the third month 3 weeks or so not just vivid dreams but nightmares nightmares that wake me up in sweats that make me cry and that 100 stick with me all day nobody ever warned me about adult nightmares as a kid yeah you dream about monsters in your closet santa not bringing you gifts and embarrassing things happening at school no big deal

now my dreams are filled with every situation in my mind that i’ve ever been anxious about severe health issues getting into car wrecks my family dying horrible deaths my friends and partner betraying me getting murdered or worse my house burning down getting fired from my job and being homeless the list goes on i’m afraid to fall asleep my sleep is no longer consistent and i’m having days like today where i’m like “shit am i even real am i dreaming or am i conscious”

"need help getting through to my dadsevere depression anxiety guilt and unwilling to try to get better hi all  any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated to help me get through to my dad 

long story short my dad has had severe depression and anxiety for a couple years and ended up making an attempt to take his own life back in 2020 he nor my mom really talked about his depression before and we didnt really even know about it so the suicide attempt was a complete shock he started seeing someone and doing therapy and trying different medications but always complained about the side effects and would come up with excuses for how he was feeling according to my mom he never liked going to the doctor or getting this kind or help and thought he was a lesser person for taking medications i think this has led to major trust issues with his therapist and psychiatrist about a year ago he made the decision that he wanted to stop taking any medication at all

the past couple months have been pretty terrible and he cant even cope with the smallest things that happen for instance recently he was carrying groceries in and a jar of sauce fell out of the bag and shattered and he had a complete meltdown over it and his day was completely derailed the smallest things cause him to lose any ability to function

this all has been extremely tough on my mom and she has talked to me about the possibility of leaving my dad dad tells mom every day he loves her but makes no effort to get better today i find out from my mom that dads psychiatrist or therapist cant recall which one had been giving my dad exercises to do between sessions and my dad makes zero effort to attempt them and the guy he is seeing can tell my dad isnt even trying to get better this guy gave my dad an ultimatum and dad needs to make an effort and prove that he is making an effort or provider is done working with my dad as hes got other patients that want help and are willing to work at it my mom also basically tacked on an ultimatum that he has to try and get better or she is gone as well

its really hard to help someone that doesnt want to help themselves and this has been going on for years hopefully the ultimatums are the kick in the ass he needs to get on the right track and try but it could also just send him down a road he wont ever come back from

i feel like at bare minimum he needs to get back on a low dose medication to help even a little bit would love to see him do more of an intensive outpatient program but he would certainly fight that tooth and nail he literally cant cope with making his own decisions and carries around so much guilt from his suicide attempt 

my brother is home this weekend and i think we need to all get together and talk to him really not sure what to do or say to help weve all been trying to support him but he just wont do anything to get better he really needs some sort of intervention but i dont know what will get through to him and i dont want to just keep piling everything on when he cant cope with the smallest of hiccups both my parents are retired and i feel terrible for my mom as well she has mentioned she feels trapped in her own house and is worried sick about my dad all the time it isnt fair to her to be miserable all the time as well because of my dad

any help thoughts guidance would be so incredibly helpful im just really at a loss for what i can do or say to even help",1
"biggest tips for overthinking and anxious thoughts towards people hi all

i’ve struggled with really bad anxiety for a while and i’m on medication for anxietydepression at the moment i’ve actually made a lot of progress over the last few months although something i still find myself doing at times is selfsabotaging because of my anxious thoughts and overthinking

i have a friend who is really close to me and i genuinely adore her so much  she’s done so much for me and i couldn’t thank her enough although whenever she doesn’t want to talk because she has her own stuff going on or she’s going through things herself i can’t help but automatically get anxious and jump to the conclusion that i’ve done something wrong and she hates me

i absolutely hate that my brain works like this i’ve started journaling my thoughts down but sometimes my anxiety gets so bad i let it all out and i’ve actually pushed her further away at times recently because of how anxious i’ve been

because i keep thinking im gonna throw up and i dont know if your body can just throw up randomly or not but i heard it can happen but i need a tiny bit of reassurance for this right now because i dont want to keep googling about it  and i keep thinking about throw up and washing my hands a lot and avoiding most foods and avoiding my family who sometimes get common colds etc

and i dont want to have to keep thinking about worrying about throwing up unless im actually very very ill or something and when i was younger i used to always cover my ears when somebody gagged or threw up and i still do it

and i know that other people on this sub probably suffer with this to which gives me some comfort and i have hard some people saying that throwing is rare and i heard people can go years and years without throwing up  like 2040 years  or some people just never throw up or you have to give your body a good reason to do it and i heard that adults throw up way less then kids which gives me more comfort

 i have no clue if any of that is true tho but i hope it is 

sorry for this stupid post but yeah im only posting this because i keep thinking im gonna throw up or something and im wondering on the causes of throwing up in general

"i need help and its serious ill appreciate if u take the time to read the whole thing and help me it will be long but your help is appreciated 

im m21 and ive been jerking off since i was 12 ill start with what i used to do when i was 12 and where im currently

age 12
nothing serious i was jerking off to my school teachers and classmates just like every other guy did it never affected my life

age 13
i got access to 2g internet so now i can see women on the internet who are far more beautiful and superior than the ones i see in the real life sometimes i would jerk off to these pics of girls on the internet both sfw and nsfw whatever i liked no strong preference other than beauty most of the time i still jerked off to my teachers and classmates or tutionmates so nothing serious i was not addicted to anything when i felt horny i jerked as simple as that

age 15
i got access to a smartphone with 4g internet and this where my downfall started now i started to watch porn sometimes and i still utilised most of my time doing more important stuff like studying solving puzzles watching tv playing games friends etc life was still fine and i still prefered my tution mates for jerking i would just watch porn and imagine the same with my tution mate and jerk my porn consumption and masturbation frequency was in moderation i was not addicted

age 16 
i visited my maternal grandparents i saw my aunt and immediately felt things for her i jerked off to her multiple times i would just get hard by looking at her in different positions now this is where things got worse because i looked up aunt nephew porn and i got addicted to it and the reason was not sex but the plot and the storyline and immorality cheating etc etc all the bad things that will fuck up your mind and are considered taboo
from this i got introduced to incest porn i dont watch shit with step in it i need biological stuff or something without the step word yep this how bad my condition was 

age 18
depressed suicidal thoughts no interaction with anyone no life only me my phone porn and the depression this is when i started going gym and everything improved drastically i stopped watching porn my life improved no depression anymore no suicidal thought nothing i gained over 20 pounds in 2 months yes i consumed more than 3000 calories each day after 6 months i was jacked af strong and sexy no porn no masturbation perfect life still felt nothing for real life females my brain have been desensitized 

age 19
i got a job still going gym and trying to make money online because of my aura and stature now females would come and talk to me guys respected me i started talking to a girl in the office and we became really good friends i was thinking of taking things further with her i still felt no sexual attraction to her but i was ready to have her in my life and explore things together after two months i got into a conflict in office and beat the manager there so they kicked me out of the company i was not at fault the manager hit me in the head first so i beat him simple the girl left her job for me we went to few companies together but no luck she had her exams so she decided to study i stopped giving her attention because now im back to my previous life

age 20
still jacked as fuck and confident no one can look at me and think hes a loser who jerks all day now i started to look at more questionable porn porn that looked almost real incest pov porn where the girl cheats on her partner with me i keep looking at these and jerk off i managed to find real incest videos yes real incest with proof these are available on the surface web itself dont have to dig much i watched mainstream incest movies now i started to roleplay with females online around topics like incest and cheating there are many dudes who will share pics of their wives if i ask them and ill tribute cum to their wives i dont like it much but im doing it i think the reason is because it releases more dopamine or serotonin its the same feeling when i first started watching incest porn after looking at my aunt i know if i keep doing this it will become normal to me i ask for pics to girls online there are alot of girls also who will show themselves if you can talk to them properly for me its easy

yesterday i jerked off to someone whom i would never ever sleep with in real life and the only reason i masturbated was i talked to this chick for 34 hours i wasnt hard after looking at her naked body but i started stroking and got hard and soon ejaculated i wish i never did this i feel disgusted with myself and what i jerked off to

it feels as if ive multiple personality disorder when im on the internet i do all this dirty things but as soon as i turn off the internet i become normal but the urges kick in and the internet loser takes over me my both personalities have different traits different talking style everything i even use different names for each im confused and fucked if i dont quit the other loser will take over my life and will kill me a loser will reside in my body

i feel utterly disgusted since yesterday i showered twice brushed my teeth thrice but the disgusted kills me

i really need help on how do i quit this cycle previously it was gym that set me free from this loser

i suspect ive pme anything else idk i literally feel like there are two souls fighting inside me


any advice and help will be appreciated if u read this far thank u sm

i just need help i dont like what im doing but even when doing it feels like im fighting with the horny loser me at the end i end up doing it and regretits fucking difficult ",1
"i’ve just experienced my first anxiety attack i guess i’m coming on here to get a better understanding possibly from someone else who has experienced this and can help me come to terms with what happened to me as it’s been quite terrifying to say the least

first of all background on myself i’m 28 f fit and healthy i wouldn’t say i would be an anxious person however i do tend to worryoverthink certain things ie work health of family members etc but i am not diagnosed with or would say i have anxiety

i am currently on a vacationtrip with my long term bf and as far as feeling relaxed and having no worriesissues goes i would say i’m 100 feeling happy and content so this is why i’m struggling to come to terms with the next part

2 days ago i was stood in our air bb cooking dinner and all of a sudden my right hand went numb along with my right ear panic kicked in and i could feel my heart pounding this lasted for a couple of minutes and then went away but my heart was still going and i was severely shaken up i genuinely thought i was having a stroke scared and worried we rang for an ambulance and whilst we waited it came on again this time both hands and both feet went completely numbtingling this lasted longer than the first time

im not too sure if ive done this right so im sorry if i havent this is my first post on reddit

im having a very bad day the last few months have gotten worse for about a year ive become someone entirely different and i just hate it one half of my body is miserable fed up i dont want to get out of bed i dont want to do anything to think eat converse i just want to be alone secluded away from everything and everyone 

the other half of me is so panicky im in constant overdrive i need to be productive i need to be doing something so that im a worthwhile person my depression always wins out though i have three boys who with my husband are the only reasons im here still

the last few months i have thoughts about how to not exist anymore but i dont want to upset anyone i just want to go silently like i never existed in the first place but i cant so i stay i stay because my husband lost his mum at 14 and i see the affect its had on him i wouldnt want that for our boys 

it would be incredible selfish of me to leave him with all the responsibilities of our children as well im so miserable ive failed at life at being a mother being a friend or family member i just dont want to speak to anyone anymore i avoid people avoid outings and if we do go out im panicking and overwhelemed  i know this is probably some sort of social anxiety 

the thing is i dont want to go to anyone i dont want this to be on my record i feel so ashamed like i should be okay why am i not okay why am i not happy i should be fine so going to a specialist theyll ask questions social services might get involved and think im not good enough to raise my kidsmy kids never go without i love them cuddle talk play they have food i go without if were struggling financially i dont want people to know how i am 

my husband knows a little he just said well be okay one day were a team things will get better i promise i love him so much and hes so supportive but i just want to shout and say no its not okay im done with this life 

its been a bad day i cried i thought about how i can leave but then i just feel awful for my boys they deserve a mother who is all here but its not me is it 

if youve read this far thank you im not really looking for comments i dont know what im looking for i type messages to my husband and then delete them so i just have no where else i think i can be open i havent told my husband i think about leaving or how to not exist it would probably break his heart and im already a shitty wife as it is

"is this offensive with people with depression i am not saying i am right this is what i think  1st ive been advised against judging or comparing because the experience with depression it unique to each individual from what ive observed i dont believe that experiences of depression are unique and special instead it seems that individuals grappling with social depression often share similar causes symptoms and approaches to treatment

i become frustrated with individuals go to therapy and take medication but neglect to follow their treatment plan they fail to adopt healthy habits make little effort to connect with others and most concerning of all refuse to even get out of bed its particularly disheartening when someone wont make the effort to get out of bed because it suggests a lack of willingness to try to improve their situation

everyone agreed its offensive i was called a troll stubborn closeminded crazy if you are depressed and dont try actively to improve that how are you getting better make it make sense

i have the hardest time managing to stay seated for much of a duration when attempting to watch any of my wonderful collections of movies and bl dramas i already have sitting on my computer chatgtp tells me i can call this symptom sensory overwhelm during screen time  
my tendency say while watching lawrence on msnbc is to multitask going off to different screens doing other tasks while still listening to the audio obviously this action is impossible during a movie or drama

so stimming anyone lol

what is considered an eating disorder vs disordered eating okay so when i am current 24f turning 25 in a month woohoo and when i was 1819 i struggled with food and body image i would sneak into my parents’ bedroom any chance i got to weigh myself i didn’t have my own scale at the time and then i’d go to work i’d be out all day working from like 9am to 11pm a lot of days in a restaurant but i usually didn’t eat unless i felt i was going to pass out or something i also have social anxiety and i was working as a hostess dealing with constant anxiety and multiple anxiety attacks a day so the stress was taking a toll on me and i think that sort of made me dig more into the not eating like you know how some people eat more when their stressed and some people eat less i’m more likely to eat less at least i was at that time so even when i went and got something to eat i usually ate half and tossed the rest if i was feeling lightheaded or affected by not having anything in my system i would run to the restaurant line where all the cooks and servers were zooming through grab a piece of the complimentary bread that served as an appetizer for the guests and hide in the back while i stuffed my face sometimes i did eat the free soup but that was usually on saturdays potato soup day there were days when i would feel really sick and throw up at the end of the day because my body was reacting to not having enough foodnutrients my dad realized something was wrong and at the time i had been working two restaurant jobs for a few months and he told me i needed to quit one of my jobs i ended up quitting being a hostess and just working in the other restaurant something eventually flipped and i started overeating instead of holding back i was doing the opposite of what i was doing before just eating eating eating and i was fine with it until i gained 33lbs in less than a year my doctor was concerned and ran a bunch of tests and questioned if i was underweight before she thought it was insane how quickly i’d put on that weight so embarrassing anyway i’m not really like that anymore i have a pretty decent mindset in terms of body image i’m just thinking about it because for the past few days i’ve been eating a bit less out of pure laziness there’s no correlation between right now and then like i wake up and the last thing i want to do is cook or go out and buy food so i just don’t and then i blink and it’s 1205am and my stomach is killing me because i forgot to eat something but it’s just reminding me of that time in my life and i have questions about it i mean i never considered it an eating disorder back then because that seems a bit dramatic i don’t even remember that well but i don’t even think i lost a ton of weight at that time i just wasn’t eating so was that considered an eating disorder or is there a such thing as just disordered eating as in not eating in a regular sense i’ll also note that the only time fall into old patterns like that these days is when i’m really stressed out but i can pull myself back pretty quickly i think ,1

"can your panic attacks change with age i’m 23f with anxiety and ptsd and have been having panic attacks on and off since i was 12 i’ve been in therapy for years and i’d like to think i do a good job coping with my anxious thoughts

usually they start with a thought  some sort of cognitive spiral into the worst thing that could possibly happen and then they devolve into hyperventilation of some sort 

but lately i’ve had two “episodes” started with nothing at all there was no trigger 

they both started while i was lying down
i immediately felt lightheaded and my heart rate jumped astronomically high then i got tingling in my arms and legs and face and blurry vision like the blood in my eyes was pounding the first one was so bad i actually fainted which ended the episode 

they each last for over an hour and afterwards i feel exhausted and anxious having never experienced this before it was quite jarring to learn that it was likely a panic attack 

is this my new normal does anyone else have the experience of developing “different” panic attacks in their 20s

in november i was told i was done jumping everything checked and the appliction went in

i was going to have the conclusion in may at the end of june i lose my right for pay in waiting

today they called and told me that the few weeks of therapy im supposed to get some time between september and march means i havent tried everything it might heal me so if i dont withdraw the application it will be denied

i feel like a complete failure is life when it comes to my financial situation i quit a job of 11 years i always felt like an imposter doing what i was doing and felt like the company didn’t value me  i left that job to go to another company in the same industry with the hopes of making more money it was solely a sales job the company culture was completely toxic and i hated everyone i was working with it was a  medical equipment sales job the vast majority of people i worked with were completely immoral and would do or say anything to get a sale needless to say it was a spectacular failure for me

so through the month of april i would get episodes like this where mt hr would spike highest 180s along with the vision lightheaded shaky etc nownirs june and still i still get them ive had similarish episodes to these for years now not this frequent and they mainly happened right around my period so i thought it was hormonal however now they happened at the most random time

i see a cardiologist already and have had monitors etc today i was told i have ist but my hr is mainly in the 80s i thought ist was when your rhr was 100 bpm i also have thought that i may have pots i had the flu for the first time in january but none of my providers are considering doing a ttt

"does anyone else have small episodes of depression or anxiety when medicated i am curious to see if anyone else experiences these random flare ups of symptoms even when taking the medications it’s almost like someone with chronic pain who has “flare ups” from time to time sometimes i’ll be good like i’m not gonna let things get me worked up or anxious a lot of the time i can let things roll and go with the flow pretty well

i can reframe toxic thoughts and think positively and see the brighter side of tough situations then there are other times when i simply cannot get my shit together i’m angsty everything is annoying me and i’m really snappy with everyone oftentimes i lash out at those i love and in the moment it feels like i’m standing up for myself because “i’m tired of how people are treating me” however when i look back and reflect on these situations most of the time my anxiety has just taken over and i started getting irritable and snappy with everyone

one  solution that the medical professionals have suggested is taking a low dose of short acting anxiety medication this was working but now its just feels like i take it to sedate me basically to the point that i just sit there and not give a fuck about anything however it doesn’t feel like im living when i do that what kind of life is it if you go through it without feeling anything

and the part that bothers me most is that everyone in my life seems to be okay with that like when i’m good everyone is so suppotive and loving but when an issue arises that upsets me so much its triggering it feels like im expected to just go dope myself up even more so that i’m no longer a problem for the people around me oftentimes nobody looks at what got me upset and when i try to convey that to people i only get more pissed about it

sometime i feel like i’m being triggered and in past relationships people have used my triggers to hurt me work me up into sheer rage and sit there and play the victim then i spend a week or more feeling like shit about the things i said or did it used to be so much worse than it is now because it would be and endless cycle of full blown mania and full blown depression just rapid cycling week in and week out

thankfully that is no longer the case i can tell that the medications are working because i have the ability to slow down and think through things but still every so often something will happen to upset me and things that i thought that i had dealt with and moved of from come bubbling back up again next thing i know i’m pissed and just hurting everyone with my words and actions in the moment it feels like i’m right and that life is just attacking me with perpetual bullshit that i have to go through with people around me

i used to drink to get myself through these “flare ups” and that was an absolute disaster it seemed to only make these “flare ups” last longer and become more intense now i just take extra anxiety medicine and i smoke pot so i don’t feel like a zombie and that hepls me enjoy life as opposed to staying doped up on medications that turn my mind into an emotionless prison and even when i quit smoking weed it didn’t help stop the flare ups i just simply didnt enjoy life i sat at home and got fat ate a shit ton of sugary food and just layer in the bed and jerked off in an attempt to feel some sort of pleasure in life bit as long as i was taking my meds nobody gave a shit i took me mustering up the courage back in 2017 to go out with a former friend and smoking pot and for the first time in 5yrswhen i first got diagnosed i was told that pot was making me sick and i actually enjoyed my life again i was leaving the house working i have developed hobbies and i would not have done any of that without using weed to get me out of those slumps i’ve been promoted at my job and  have held this job down throgh some of the darker point in my life i guess the point here is that i think cannabis helps me more than hurts and also not smoking cannabis didn’t help my mental health at all

if anyone else has had any experiences similar to mine please leave me some advice or stories that you think may help or at least provide some food for thought i appreciate and love you all so much thank you",1
